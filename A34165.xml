            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1. To the di≈øtre≈øs it ≈øelf: Then</p>
            <p n="2">2. To the per≈øon thus perplexed: <hi>I am in a great ≈øtrait: David</hi> a great man, <hi>David</hi> a Godly man.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the perplexity it ≈øelf we ≈øhall con≈øider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The reality of this perplexity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The greatne≈øs of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the reality of it: after <hi>David</hi> had ≈øinned in numbring the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, God ≈øends the Prophet <hi>Gad</hi> to him, and puts three things to his choice, as you may read in <hi>ver≈ø.</hi> 12. God was determined to make <hi>David</hi> ≈ømart for numbring the people, but leaves it to <hi>Davids</hi> liberty, whether he would have ≈øeven years famine, or three moneths to flee before his enemies, or three dayes pe≈øtilence: This was a po≈øing que≈øtion, and
<pb facs="tcp:62760:4"/>
               <hi>David</hi> had cau≈øe to be in a great ≈øtrait; for the≈øe objects are not amiable in their own nature, they are objects to be avoided and declined; in the fir≈øt view of them they ≈øeem to be equally mi≈øerable, therefore <hi>David</hi> had cau≈øe to ≈øay he was in a ≈øtrait.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This perplexity was not only real, but exceeding great: <hi>I am in a great ≈øtrait:</hi> and there were two things made this ≈øo great.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The greatne≈øs of the puni≈øhments propo≈øed, Famine, Sword, and Plague: the≈øe are the three Be≈øomes with which God ≈øweeps mankind from off the Earth: the≈øe are Gods three Iron whips, by which he cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øti≈øeth ≈øinful man: the≈øe are the three Arrows ≈øhot out of the Quiver of Gods wrath, for the puni≈øhment of man; they are as one calleth them, <hi>Ton≈øurae humani generis.</hi> In <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. you ≈øhall read of four Hor≈øes, when the four fir≈øt Seals were opened, a white Hor≈øe, a red Hor≈øe, a black Hor≈øe, and a pale Hor≈øe: After Chri≈øt had ridden on the white Hor≈øe, propagating the Go≈øpel, then follows the red Hor≈øe, a type of War; then the black Hor≈øe, an Hieroglyphick of Famine: then the pale Hor≈øe, the emblem of Pe≈øtilence. Now God was re≈øolved to ride on one of the≈øe Hor≈øes, and <hi>David</hi> mu≈øt chu≈øe upon which God ≈øhould ride: this is a great ≈øtrait: let me pre≈øent <hi>Davids</hi> lifting up his eyes to Heaven, and ≈øpeaking to God thus; O my God, what is this me≈ø≈øage thou ha≈øt ≈øent me? thou offere≈øt me three things: I am in a ≈øtrait, I know which to re≈øu≈øe, but which to chu≈øe I know not: Shall the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> a Land flowing with milk and honey, ≈øhall this Land endure ≈øeven years Famine, and be turned into a Wilderne≈øs, and di≈øpeopled? and ≈øhall I, who≈øe hands thou ha≈øt taught to fight, and who≈øe fingers to war, ≈øhall I that have ≈øubdued all mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ≈øhall I in my old age, and all my Captains, fly three months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our enemies, and be driven to Caves and Rocks to hide our ≈øelves? O thou my God, who art my refuge, ≈øhall I and my people be a prey to the Pe≈øtilence, that walketh in darkne≈øs and de≈øtruction, that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at noon day? O my God, I know not what to do, <hi>I am in a great ≈øtrait.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The ≈øecond rea≈øon why this ≈øtrait was ≈øo great, was<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> becau≈øe of the guilt of ≈øin that lay on <hi>Davids</hi> ≈øpirit: for <hi>David</hi> knew that this ≈øevere me≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage was the fruit of the ≈øin he committed in numbring the people. But you will ≈øay, Why, was it a ≈øin in <hi>David</hi> to number the people? <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> had often numbred the people, three times, and it was not counted ≈øin. <hi>Jo≈øephus</hi> an≈øwereth, the ≈øin of <hi>David</hi> was, becau≈øe he did not require the half ≈øhekel, which he was to have had from all that were numbered, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.12, 13.</p>
            <p>Others ≈øay he ≈øinned in numbring all ages, whereas he was to number
<pb facs="tcp:62760:4"/>but from twenty years: but the≈øe are conjectural rea≈øons. I conceive the ≈øin of <hi>David</hi> was, becau≈øe he did it without a lawful call, and for an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful end: <hi>Sine cau≈øa legitima;</hi> he ≈øinned in the manner rather than in the matter; for there was no cau≈øe for him to number the people but curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity, and no end but vain-glory: <hi>Go through all the tribes of</hi> I≈ørael, <hi>and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the people, that I may know the number of my people,</hi> v. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Davids</hi> heart was lifted up with pride, and creature-confidence: he begins to boa≈øt of the multitude of his people, and to tru≈øt in an arm of fle≈øh: therefore God ≈øends the Prophet to <hi>David,</hi> to prick the bladder of his pride; as if God ≈øhould ≈øay, I will teach you to number the people by le≈ø≈øening the number of your people. Now the burthen of his ≈øin did add much to the burthen of this heavy me≈ø≈øage: <hi>ver≈ø.</hi> 13. <hi>After David had numbered the people, his heart ≈ømote him:</hi> the me≈ø≈øage ≈ømites him, and his heart ≈ømites him; <hi>and he ≈øaid, I have ≈øinned greatly in that which I have done: now I be≈øeech thee take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the iniquity of thy ≈øervant, for I have done very fooli≈øhly.</hi> If <hi>David</hi> had been to ≈øuffer this great puni≈øhment out of love to God, or for a good Con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he would not have been ≈øo di≈øtracted. There are two ≈øorts of ≈øtraits in Scripture; ≈øome ≈øuffered for God and a good Con≈øcience, and there are ≈øtraits ≈øuffered for ≈øin.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are ≈øtraits ≈øuffered for God and a good Con≈øcience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.36, 37. tho≈øe Martyrs there were driven to great ≈øtraits: but the≈øe were ≈øtraits for God and a good Con≈øcience, and the≈øe ≈øtraits were the Saints greate≈øt enlargements, they were ≈øo ≈øweetned to them by the con≈øolations and ≈øupportations of Gods Spirit; a Pri≈øon was a Paradi≈øe to them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. they look joyfully at the ≈øpoiling of their goods, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.41. <hi>They departed from the pre≈øence of the Council, rejoycing that they were counted worthy to ≈øuffer ≈øhame for his Name.</hi> Straits for a good con≈øcience are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øt enlargements; therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> glorieth in his ≈øtrait, <hi>Paul a Pri≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are ≈øtraits ≈øuffered for ≈øin, and the≈øe are envenomed by the guilt of ≈øin: ≈øin puts poy≈øon into all our di≈øtre≈ø≈øes and perplexities. Now ≈øuch was the ≈øtrait into which <hi>David</hi> was now driven, it was a ≈øtrait cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed by fin, and that made it ≈øo unwelcome and uncomfortable: ≈øo that from hence I gather this Ob≈øervation.</p>
            <p>Doctrine. <hi>That ≈øin and iniquity brings per≈øons and Nations into marvellous labyrinths and perplexities; into time, real, and great mole≈øtations; and a man free from ≈øin, is free in the mid≈øt of ≈øtraits; a man guilty of ≈øin, is in a ≈øtrait in the mid≈øt of freedom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After <hi>Adam</hi> had ≈øinned in eating the forbidden fruit, the whole world was a pri≈øon to him: Paradi≈øe it ≈øelf was an Hell to him, he knew not
<pb facs="tcp:62760:5"/>where to hide him≈øelf from the pre≈øence of God. After that <hi>Cain</hi> had murthered his Brother <hi>Abel,</hi> he was brought into ≈øuch a ≈øtrait, that he was afraid that every one that met him would ≈ølay him. Alas, poor <hi>Cain,</hi> how many there was then in the world? We read, but his Father and Mother? yet ≈øuch was his di≈øtre≈øs, teat he cryeth out, every one that met him would ≈ølav him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.14. Into what a ≈øtrait did ≈øin bring the old world? the deluge of ≈øin, brought a deluge of water to drown them. Into what a ≈øtrait did ≈øin bring <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah?</hi> the fire of Lu≈øt raigning in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> brought down fire from Heaven to de≈øtroy them. Sin brings external, internal, and eternal ≈øtraits upon per≈øons and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sin brings external ≈øtraits; Sin brings Famine, Sword, and Plague; Sin brings Agues and Fevers, Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>t and Stone, and all manner of Di≈øea≈øes: yea Sin brings death it ≈øelf, which is the wages of ≈øin. Read <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. and you will ≈øee a black Roll of cur≈øes, which were the fruit of ≈øin, Sin brought <hi>Sion</hi> into <hi>Babylon;</hi> and when the <hi>Jews</hi> had murthered <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> forty vears after they were brought into that di≈øtre≈øs, when the City was be≈øieged by <hi>Titus Ve≈øpatian,</hi> that they did eat one another, the Mother did eat her Child, that whereas <hi>David</hi> had a choice which of the three he would have, either Famine, Plague or Sword, the poor <hi>Jews</hi> had all three concatenated together in the ≈øiege. Sin brings all manner of external Plagues.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sin brought per≈øons and Nations into eternal ≈øtraits: ≈øin brings ≈øoul-plagues, which are wor≈øe then bodily plagues: ≈øin brings hardne≈øs of heart, blindne≈øs of mind, a ≈øpirit of ≈ølumber, a reprobate ≈øen≈øe: ≈øin brings a ≈øpiritual Famine upon a Land, it brings a Famine on the Word, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.11. Sin cau≈øes God to take away the Go≈øpel from a people; ≈øin brings internal plagues: ≈øin awakens Con≈øcience, and fills it full of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities. Into what a ≈øtrait did ≈øin drive <hi>Judas</hi> after he had betrayed Chri≈øt? Into what a ≈øtrait did ≈øin drive <hi>Spira?</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> glorified in his tribulations for God; but when he ≈øpeaks of his ≈øin, he cryeth out, <hi>O mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerable man that I am, who ≈øhall deliver me from this body of death? David</hi> a valiant man, when he ≈øpeaks of ≈øin, ≈øaith, <hi>they are too heavy a burden for him to bear? A wounded con≈øcience who can bear?</hi> ≈øaith the wi≈øe Man.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Sin bringeth eternal ≈øtraits. O the ≈øtrait that a wicked man ≈øhall be brought into at the great and dreadful day of Judgment, when all the world ≈øhall be on fire about him! when he ≈øhall call to the Mountains to hide him, and to the rocks to cover him from the wrath of God; then will he cry out with <hi>David, I am, O Lord, in a great ≈øtrait.</hi> And when the wicked ≈øhall be condemned to Hell, who can expre≈øs the ≈øtraits they
<pb facs="tcp:62760:5"/>then ≈øhall be in? <hi>Bind them hand and foot, and ca≈øt them into everla≈øting darkne≈øs,</hi> Mat. 25. When a wicked man ≈øhall be bound with ever la≈øting chains of darkne≈øs, then he will cry out, <hi>I am in a great ≈øtrait,</hi> Con≈øider what <hi>Dives</hi> ≈øaith to <hi>Abraham;</hi> he de≈øires that <hi>Lazarus</hi> might but dip the tip of his finger in water, and that he might cool his tongue; not his whole body, but his tongue; but that would not be granted.</p>
            <p>It is impo≈ø≈øible the tongue of man ≈øhould ≈øet out the great ≈øtraits the damned ≈øuffer in Hell, both in regard of the greatne≈øs and everla≈øtingne≈øs of them.</p>
            <p>This is all I ≈øhall ≈øay for the Explication.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øe</hi> 1. I chiefly aim at the Application; Doth ≈øin bring Nations and Per≈øons into external, internal, and eternal ≈øtraits? then this ≈øadly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves tho≈øe that chu≈øe to commit ≈øin to avoid perplexity. There are thou≈øands in <hi>England</hi> guilty of this, that to avoid poverty, will lye, cheat and couzen, and to gain an e≈øtate will ≈øell God and a good con≈øcience, and to avoid the lo≈øs of e≈øtate and impri≈øonment, will do any thing; they will be ≈øure to be of that Religion which is uppermo≈øt, be it what it will. Now give me leave this morning to ≈øpeak three things to the≈øe ≈øort of men, and O that my words might prevail with them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Con≈øider it is ≈øin only that makes trouble de≈øerve the name of trouble; for when we ≈øuffer for Gods ≈øake, or a good Con≈øcience, the≈øe troubles are ≈øo ≈øweetned by the con≈øolations of Heaven, that they are no troubles at all: therefore in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes the Martyrs wrote to their friends out of pri≈øon, <hi>If you knew the comforts we have in Pri≈øon, you would wi≈øh to be with us. I am in Pri≈øon before I am in Pri≈øon,</hi> ≈øaith Mr. <hi>Sanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Famous is the ≈øtory of the three Children: they were in a great ≈øtrait when ca≈øt into the fiery Furnace: <hi>Bind them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                  </gap> and and foot, and ca≈øt them into the Furnace;</hi> but when they were there, they were unbound, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.25. ≈øaith <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Did not we ca≈øt three men bound into the mid≈øt of the fire? and loe I ≈øee four men loo≈øe, walking in the mid≈øt of the fire, and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.</hi> I have often told you when three are ca≈øt into the fire for a good Con≈øcience, God will make the fourth: therefore, I ≈øay, ≈øtraits and ≈øufferings for God are not worth the name of ≈øtraits. <hi>David</hi> was often driven into ≈øtraits, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6. he was ≈øore di≈øtre≈ø≈øed when his Town was burnt, and his Wives and Children taken captives by the <hi>Amalekites:</hi> I, but that was a di≈øtre≈øs of danger, not of ≈øin; therefore he encouraged him≈øelf in the Lord his God. <hi>Jeho≈øaphat</hi> was in a great ≈øtrait, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.12. <hi>We know not what to do,</hi> ≈øaith he; this was a ≈øtrait of danger, not cau≈øed by his ≈øin; and God
<pb facs="tcp:62760:6"/>quickly delivered him: but the ≈øtrait that <hi>David</hi> was in, was cau≈øed by his ≈øin, and that made it ≈øo bitter. I am loath to enlarge here: St. <hi>Paul</hi> was in a great ≈øtrait, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.23. but this was a ble≈ø≈øed ≈øtrait, an Evangelical ≈øtrait, ≈øaith St. <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtome, He knew not whether to die for his own ≈øake, or to live for the Churches ≈øake, were be≈øt:</hi> he was willing to adjourn his going to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the good of the people of God. Nay, Chri≈øt was in a ≈øtrait, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.15. <hi>I have a bapti≈øm to be baptized withal, and how am I ≈øtraitned till it be accompli≈øhed?</hi> I am to ≈øhed my blood for my Elect; this is the bapti≈øm he ≈øpeaks of.</p>
            <p>This was a ≈øtrait of dear affection to the Elect of God: all the≈øe were ble≈ø≈øed ≈øtraits: but now a ≈øtrait cau≈øed by ≈øin, the≈øe are imbittered and envenomed by the guilt of ≈øin, and ≈øen≈øe of Gods wrath. It is ≈øin that maketh ≈øtraits de≈øerve the name of ≈øtraits; therefore you are ≈øpiritually mad that commit ≈øin to avoid ≈øtraits.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is more evil in the lea≈øt ≈øin, than in the greate≈øt outward ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity what≈øoever: this the world will not believe; therefore St. <hi>Au≈øtin</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>That a man ought not to tell a lye, though he might ≈øave all the world from hell: for there is more evil in one lye, than there is good in the ≈øalvation of all the world.</hi> I have often told you the ≈øtory of St. <hi>Au≈øtin,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>If Hell were on one ≈øide, and ≈øin on the other, and I mu≈øt chu≈øe one, I would chu≈øe hell rather than ≈øin: for God is the Author of Hell, but it is bla≈øphemy to ≈øay he is the Author of Sin.</hi> There is a famous ≈øtory of <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, King of <hi>France,</hi> he ≈øent a me≈ø≈øage to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> a zealous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtant, gives him three things to chu≈øe, either to go to <hi>Ma≈øs,</hi> or to be put to death, or to ≈øuffer bani≈øhment all his life long: ≈øaith he, <hi>Primum Deo, juvante nunquam eligo: The fir≈øt (God helping) I will never chu≈øe, I abhor the Idolatry of the Ma≈øs; but for the two other, I leave it to the choice of the King to do as he plea≈øes: there is more evil in the lea≈øt ≈øin, than the greate≈øt mi≈øery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The third thing I would have you con≈øider, that who≈øoever goeth out of Gods way to avoid danger, ≈øhall certainly meet with greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. <hi>Balaam</hi> went out of Gods way, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.22. and God ≈øent an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel with a drawn ≈øword, and he riding upon an A≈ø≈øe, <hi>ver≈øe</hi> 26. the Angel ≈øtood in a narrow place, where was no way to go from the right hand or from the left: if his A≈ø≈øe had not fallen under him, he had been run thorow by the ≈øword of the Angel. <hi>Jonah,</hi> for fear of the King of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> went out of Gods way, but he met with a mighty tempe≈øt, he met with a Whale. What do you do when you commit ≈øin? you make way to be ca≈øt into the eternal pri≈øon of Hell; you de≈øtroy your precious ≈øouls, to ≈øave your peri≈øhing bodies.</p>

If ≈øin be the father and mother of all perplexity and di≈øtre≈ø≈øes, then I be≈øeech you, let us above all things in the world abhor ≈øin: all the cur≈øes of the Bible are all due only to a ≈øinner; and all the cur≈øes not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the Bible: for that is ob≈øervable, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.36. every plague that is not written in the Book ≈øhall light upon him: there are ≈øtrange puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the workers of iniquity, <hi>Job</hi> 31.3.

            <p n="1">1. Take heed of Covetou≈øne≈øs: the love of the world will pierce you thorow with many ≈øorrows? the love of money is the root of all evil; the love of the world drowns men in perdition.</p>

            <p>IN the former Chapter you have a <hi>≈øpiritual Chronicle,</hi> or a Catalogue of the Lords Worthies, and all the eminent effects of their <hi>Faith;</hi> and now the Apo≈øtle comes to make u≈øe of this Hi≈øtory, that he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced through ≈øo many ≈øucce≈ø≈øions of Ages of all the holy men of God that excelled in Faith. <hi>Wherefore ≈øeeing we are compa≈ø≈øed about with ≈øo great a cloud of Witne≈ø≈øes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:62760:8"/>Fir≈øt, Here are <hi>witne≈ø≈øes;</hi> by that term we are to under≈øtand tho≈øe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Saints mentioned and reckoned up in the former Chapter, <hi>Abel, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch, Noah, Abraham, Mo≈øes,</hi> &amp;c.

This <hi>witne≈øs</hi> was partly in their <hi>Faith,</hi> and partly in the <hi>fruit</hi> of their <hi>Faith.</hi>

And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. They witne≈ø≈øed in the fruits of their faith, as they give us an in≈øtance of Gods fidelity towards them that faithfully adhere to, and firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in his promi≈øes; ≈øo it is ≈øaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Be not ≈ølothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promi≈øe.</hi> Let <hi>Faith</hi> but ≈øet <hi>Patience</hi> a work, do but hold out a little while with God, and you may learn by the example of all tho≈øe holy men, we ≈øhall inherit the promi≈øes, they ≈øhall be made good to a tittle, and nor one thing fail of all that the Lord hath ≈øpoken; as tho≈øe holy men were exerci≈øed and to≈ø≈øed to and fro, but it ≈øucceeded well with them at the la≈øt. O then let us hearken to the depo≈øition of the≈øe worthy witne≈ø≈øes that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Scripture, and with ≈øuch an invincible re≈øolution as theirs was, let us hold out our cour≈øe towards true happine≈øs: If we do not, they that are now propounded as Witne≈ø≈øes to us, will at the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be produced as witne≈ø≈øes again≈øt us. And pray al≈øo let us remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that we are to continue and keep afoot that te≈øtimony to ≈øucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generations: for not only the Prophets and holy men of God, were Gods witne≈ø≈øes, but all Gods people al≈øo are his witne≈ø≈øes, <hi>I≈øai.</hi> 43.10. by their faith, patience, diligence, con≈øtancy and chearfulne≈øs under affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, they are to give it under hand and ≈øeal to the world, that God is a true and faithful God. But now, if we either by our ≈øinful walking, or by our drooping di≈øcouragements, di≈øcredit Chri≈øt and his profe≈ø≈øion, then we, are witne≈ø≈øes again≈øt him, we deny that <hi>Religion</hi> which we would ≈øeem to profe≈øs and cry up, (<hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16.) <hi>They profe≈øs they know God, but in works they deny him;</hi> and the more dangerous, becau≈øe <hi>deeds</hi> are more deliberate than <hi>words,</hi> and ≈øo a greater evidence of what we think in our hearts. If we by drooping di≈øcouragements and ≈øinful walking
<pb facs="tcp:62760:9"/>di≈øcredit Religion, we deny it, and do in effect put the lye upon <hi>Chri≈øt.</hi> Therefore let us remember they were witne≈ø≈øes, and ≈øo mu≈øt we.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By a figurative ≈øpeech they are called a <hi>Cloud, [having a cloud of witne≈ø≈øes]</hi> why ≈øo? I might trouble you with many conceits Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have had of this word <hi>Cloud;</hi> ≈øay ≈øome, becau≈øe of the rai≈øedne≈øs of their ≈øpirits, becau≈øe Clouds fly aloft: <hi>Clouds,</hi> for the fruitfulne≈øs of their Doctrine, as Clouds ≈øend down fruitful ≈øhowers upon the <hi>earth;</hi> &amp; <hi>Clouds,</hi> becau≈øe they cool and cover us from the heat; ≈øo ≈øome would glo≈øs for our comfort: others with more judgment ≈øay, a <hi>Cloud</hi> with allu≈øion to the <hi>pillar of cloud</hi> which conducted the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> to <hi>Canaan;</hi> yet neither doth this come up fully to the ≈øcope of the Apo≈øtle; for the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaks not of a Cloud that goes before us, but of a <hi>Cloud that compa≈ø≈øeth us round about,</hi> and therefore a <hi>Cloud;</hi> the rea≈øon why 'tis called ≈øo, is the number and multitude of tho≈øe Witne≈ø≈øes, as a Cloud is made up of a multitude of vapours gathered together, and conden≈øed into one body; and ≈øo the expre≈ø≈øion is often u≈øed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38.9. <hi>Thou ≈øhalt be like a cloud to cover the Land,</hi> &amp;c. noting the increa≈øe of the people when God would re≈øtore them, the multitude of Converts; and ≈øo in prophane Authors, <hi>Livie</hi> hath ≈øuch an expre≈ø≈øion, an army of men is called a <hi>cloud.</hi> But this is enough to ≈øhew the intent of this expre≈ø≈øion, that there are a multitude, a very great number: though the godly comparatively, and with re≈øpect to the wicked, are a few, yet con≈øidered in them≈øelves, they are a great number; for, if the Martyrs, and tho≈øe glorious in≈øtances of Heroick ≈øaith, and that under the Old Te≈øtament, when Gods Intere≈øt was more confin'd to one People, if there were ≈øuch a Church then, of ≈øo great a number, what will the whole Church of the Old and New Te≈øtament be, when we ≈øhall meet together in Heaven? We are often di≈øcouraged with the paucity of Profe≈ø≈øors, and are apt to think our ≈øelves to be <hi>left alone,</hi> 1 Kings 19.10. But let us remember there is a <hi>Cloud of Witne≈ø≈øes,</hi> we are not ≈øolitary now, and certainly we ≈øhall not want company when we come to Heaven, <hi>To the innumerable company of,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Again, it meets with an ordinary and ≈øtrong temptation which Satan ≈øugge≈øts to the heart of the godly, that they are ≈øingular and matchle≈øs in <hi>their afflictions,</hi> that none of the people of God have ever under gone ≈øuch difficulties as they are expo≈øed unto; and this makes them que≈øtion their Fathers affections, and put them≈øelves out of the number of his children. I, but all the≈øe things are accompli≈øhed in the Saints of God before you, here is a <hi>Cloud of Witne≈ø≈øes</hi> that have been exerci≈øed and tryed to purpo≈øe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.9. They are troubled with a bu≈øie Devil, a naughty world, a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb facs="tcp:62760:9"/>heart, all have had their tryal from <hi>Gods</hi> correcting hand, <hi>The ≈øame afflictions are accompli≈øhed in your brethren, that are in the world.</hi> So that we have many fellows, our lot is no harder than the Saints of God that have gone before us, for there is a <hi>Cloud of Witne≈ø≈øes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Ob≈øerve, the Apo≈øtle calls it a <hi>Cloud that compa≈ø≈øes us round about,</hi> i.e. We have in≈øtances for every Tryal, Temptation, Duty that we are put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Here</hi> we have examples of tho≈øe that have fulfilled the commands of Chri≈øt on this ≈øide with an undaunted courage, and the examples of <hi>tho≈øe</hi> that have born the <hi>Cro≈øs</hi> of <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> with an invincible patience: <hi>here</hi> we have examples of tho≈øe that have conquered <hi>right-hand temptations,</hi> that have de≈øpi≈øed the delights of the world; and there are tho≈øe that have conquered <hi>left-hand temptations,</hi> that have not been broken and affrighted with the terrors of the world; all the Saints of God have trodden that way; the ≈øame paths wherein we are to walk after them: we cannot look this way or that way, but we have in≈øtances of Faith, confidence in God, and patience, <hi>we are compa≈ø≈øed about,</hi> &amp;c. In ≈øhort, here lies the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement that Chri≈øtians ≈øhould propound to them≈øelves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That there are examples.</hi> Chri≈øtians of latter times have more to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer for their infidelity, than tho≈øe of former Ages; they that fir≈øt belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the <hi>promi≈øes,</hi> believed without ≈øuch a <hi>cloud of witne≈ø≈øes,</hi> or multitude of examples; many have gone before us that have broken the Ice, and that found <hi>good</hi> ≈øucce≈øs from their own experience, they have <hi>commended God to us,</hi> as a true and faithful God, and will not you go on? When <hi>Jonathan</hi> and his Armour-bearer climbed up the Rocks of the <hi>Phili≈øtins,</hi> then the people were encouraged to go up after; ≈øo here are ≈øome that have gone before you, and it hath ≈øucceeded well with them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The≈øe examples are many;</hi> not one or two that might be ≈øuppo≈øed to be ≈øingularly a≈ø≈øi≈øted, and to have eminent Prerogatives above the re≈øt of their brethren, but many in every Age, <hi>a whole cloud of them,</hi>

               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> I an≈øwer this is the work of the Spirit of God; but we mu≈øt know, the Spirit of God doth work the work of <hi>mortification</hi> two waies: <hi>by Regeneration,</hi> and <hi>after Regeneration:</hi> By Regeneration, and ≈øo he doth immediately without any co-opperation of ours mortifie the <hi>deeds</hi> of ≈øin, gives ≈øin its death-wound; that which is left, is a thing <hi>mortified,</hi> it broken. The Scripture often ≈øpeaks of this fir≈øt work of Regenration, Rom. 6.6. Colo≈ø. 2.11.

               <item>Fir≈øt as matter of duty, It is a duty to walk with Chri≈øt.</item>
               <item>Secondly, it is matter of promi≈øe: That they keep their garments undefiled, and live in thigh favour with Chri≈øt, they ≈øhall walk with Chri≈øt: we favour tho≈øe that walk with us.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Walking with Chri≈øt notes to us three things.</p>

               <item>1. That we have peace with him.</item>

               <item>3. That his being ≈øo much above us, we ≈øhould have this favour from him.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And hence I noted the great priviledge of the people of God, that they ≈øhall walk with Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It notes the great ≈øatisfaction of the Saints to walk with Chri≈øt; they ≈øhall be filled with his company.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How ≈øafe it is, and what ≈øafety there is to walk with Chri≈øt: he hath a wing to ≈øpread over them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What opporunities ≈øuch have as walk with Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. What liberty ≈øuch have as walk with Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Such as walk with Chri≈øt, may be ≈øure he will commuicate his ≈øecrets to them, he will ≈øhow them what they have to do.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We ≈øhewed you the great goodnes of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, that he ≈øhould take ≈øuch creatures to walk with him, ≈øuch defiled creatures.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Then let us take heed of keeping our garments undefiled, le≈øt Je≈øus Chri≈øt ca≈øt us out of his company, and we can no longer walk with Chri≈øt any more. Oh take heed of walking blamele≈øs in the wayes of Chri≈øt.</p>

            <p>In opening the Text, I told you <hi>white</hi> might be con≈øidered two wayes.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 As it re≈øpects our ≈øtate, and ≈øo that by way of Ju≈øtification, and thus they ≈øhall walk with Chri≈øt; but this is not the walking <hi>in white,</hi> the Text means.</item>
               <item>2. Here is a further <hi>walking in white,</hi> and that is matter of reward to the people of God.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. To walk with Chri≈øt <hi>in white,</hi> it is matter of honour, <hi>white garments</hi> are matter of honour. Princes, great Kings <hi>walk in white garments,</hi> ≈øo the Saints of God ≈øhall <hi>walk in white</hi> Chri≈øt will honour them, and give them honour among them, becau≈øe they have kept their garments undefiled.

            <p>It is not much to us hat others ≈øay or think of us, what the wicked world judge of us, yet I ≈øay, God can and doth ≈øometimes rai≈øe a te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of honour for his people among≈øt carnal men of the world. <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi> would not defile his garments, he <hi>walked in white</hi> among≈øt men: true, he was ca≈øt into pri≈øon, what of that? he was re≈øpected by the keepers of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:62760:15"/>from their enemies: So it was the unhappy chance of <hi>Cranmer,</hi> the Pope did per≈øwade him to ≈øub≈øcribe, and did he get any honour by it? No tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they did upbraid him, and reproach him, and ≈øo he had dyed in a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving condition, had not the Lord been merciful to him. I remember a ≈øpeech of St. <hi>Au≈øtin,</hi> about drinking of healths: Oh, ≈øay they, 'tis upon the Kings Birth-day, and we cannot avoid it; if we deny it, ≈øay they, we ≈øhall be reproached and ≈øcorned of all men. He gives them many an≈øwers to it, one of which (as I remember) was this; <hi>God will ≈øo work that if you will not comply with them, they in their hearts will honour you; and whereas if you did comply with them, they would di≈øhonour you, and ≈øay you are ba≈øe ≈øpirited.</hi> That is one thing of this point, that keeping clo≈øe to Je≈øus Chri≈øt will get you this reward; you ≈øhall walk with him in the White of honour with his people, and it may be with the World too.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>They ≈øhall walk in White,</hi> in the White of peace and joy, and inward comfort.</p>
            <p>I ≈øhewed you in the opening of the Text, how the Scripture calls that walking in <hi>White,</hi> then the point is this: Whatever becomes of the other White of honour in the World, they ≈øhall be ≈øure of this, that abundance of peace, and joy, and comfort, ≈øhall po≈ø≈øe≈øs their ≈øouls that keep their garments White; they ≈øhall walk in the inward White of joy and peace with Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and this is a ble≈ø≈øed reward.</p>
            <p>Indeed now this joy, this White of joy, ari≈øes in the Soul three wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the te≈øtimony of their own Con≈øciences, O they who have a good te≈øtimony from their own con≈øciences, walk in White, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>We have this for our rejoycing, the te≈øtimony of our con≈øciences, that in all ≈øimplicity, and godly ≈øincerity, we have our conver≈øation in Heaven:</hi> that is, walking in White: this is our rejoycing, our con≈øcience ≈øpeaks well of us, and kindly to us; and who is able to expre≈øs the ≈øweetne≈øs of this thing? None can know what this is, but they that have it, as it is ≈øaid of the <hi>New Name writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon the White Stone,</hi> Rev. 2.17. 'Tis a thing beyond expre≈ø≈øion, what the joy and peace of a good Con≈øcience is! Now this I ≈øay that our White garments, and our walking in White, ari≈øeth from the te≈øtimony of our Con≈øciences.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As from the te≈øtimony of our Con≈øciences, ≈øo from that te≈øtimony which is greater than our Con≈øciences, the Spirit ≈øhedding abroad of Divine Love, thus it is with tho≈øe that do not defile their garments, but endure any thing rather than defile their garments, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>And not only ≈øo, but we glory in tribulations, knowing tribulations worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope, and

            </p>
            <p>Now they who keep their garments white, have good ground of hope of the love of God; therefore this mu≈øt needs cau≈øe them to walk com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably as they who have this hope purifie them≈øelves; ≈øo they who pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie them≈øelves, have good ground of their hope, and therein great cau≈øe to rejoyce, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 6. <hi>Who are kept by the power of God through Faith unto ≈øalvation, ready to be revealed in the la≈øt times, wherein ye greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, though now for a ≈øea≈øon (if need be) ye are in heavine≈øs through many temptations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We walk in white, in hope we have of that inheritance: now lay the≈øe three things together; If they who keep their Garments undefiled, have the te≈øtimony of their own con≈øciences, and the te≈øtimony of the Spirit, ≈øhedding the love of God in their hearts, and a well-grounded hope of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture glory, how can it be but the≈øe mu≈øt walk in white with Je≈øus Chri≈øt? that is, in comfort and joy of the Spirit, and of their own ≈øpirits.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>David</hi> walked, he had abundance of joy upon his con≈øcience of his own integrity, and of keeping his heart and hands clean from tho≈øe iniquities his enemies charged him with, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 3. <hi>The Lord ≈øhall judge his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

            <p>So <hi>Job</hi> walkt in white, though his friends black't him exceedingly, yet he walkt in white in his con≈øcience, <hi>Job</hi> 16.10. <hi>Behold my witne≈øs is in Heaven, and my record is on high:</hi> I have not only a witne≈øs in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience, but my witne≈øs is above.

            <p n="2">2. This point gives us an account why the ≈øervants of Chri≈øt ≈øtand ≈øo ≈øtrictly upon their terms with the World, even while ≈øome call it pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øhne≈øs, others ignorance, others wilful ≈øtubbornne≈øs.</p>
            <p>What is the rea≈øon? the rea≈øon is, becau≈øe they under≈øtand in ≈øome mea≈øure, and have had experience in ≈øome mea≈øure, what it is to walk in ≈øome mea≈øure with Chri≈øt in white, &amp; it hath left ≈øuch a reli≈øh upon their ≈øouls, that they would not lo≈øe it for all the dainty mor≈øels of this world; they had rather indeed walk with Chri≈øt in White, than walk with
<pb facs="tcp:62760:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>the world in ≈øcarlet; therefore they mu≈øt ≈øtand upon their terms, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.32. <hi>The lips of the Righteous know what is acceptable:</hi> The lips are in≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ≈øpeech, not faculties of knowledge. Ay, but there is a great deal of commerce and conver≈øe between the ≈øpeech and the under≈øtanding, and a righteous man will ≈øpeak nothing with his lips, but what he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtands; therefore he is ≈øaid to under≈øtand. The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: to whom? <hi>The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable to God,</hi> for they are acquainted with his rule, and God hath ≈øhown them his Covenant, he hath ≈øhewed them the pattern of his Hou≈øe, and the way of his Wor≈øhip: now becau≈øe they are pretty well skilled, and know what is acceptable to God, therefore they will run any hazard, undergo any affliction, rather than do any thing that will not plea≈øe God, or be hurtful to their own con≈øciences; they are afraid of lo≈øing their peace, and comfort, and joy with God, therefore they will not let go the ways of God, as <hi>Job</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>Job</hi> 26.6. <hi>I hold fa≈øt my integrity, and my heart ≈øhall not reproach me ≈øo long as I live:</hi> as if he had ≈øaid, You my friends have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached me, but I am re≈øolved my heart ≈øhall not reproach me ≈øo long as I live.</p>
            <p>The heart or Con≈øcience is a bu≈øie faculty, and hath many offices, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords what we do, and comes as a witne≈øs: the Con≈øcience is Judge of what we do, and accordingly reproves what we do ami≈øs; therefore ≈øaith <hi>Job, I'le take care of this:</hi> I am more afraid of the reproach of Con≈øcience, than of any man what≈øoever; therefore I will not do any thing that may cau≈øe my con≈øcience to reproach me as long as I live. This is upon the heart of Gods people, they are re≈øolved, let men reproach and rail again≈øt them as much as they will, their hearts ≈øhall not reproach them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the third place, let it be a word of Caution, and Admonition to all at this day, to take heed of defiling their garments: if you defile your garments, Chri≈øt will pronounce another ≈øentence, he will pronounce a ≈øentence again≈øt you; he hath threatnings for tho≈øe who defile their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in the place of rewards, for tho≈øe who keep them clean; they who defile garments, ≈øhall walk in garments of black, in the black of di≈øhonour, as <hi>Job</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>I walk all day mourning without the Sun:</hi> the Sun of Righteou≈øne≈øs ≈øhall not ≈øhine upon them: Oh what bitter and ≈øore things have many ta≈øted for defiling their garments, when for favour of men, or to plea≈øe men, they have ≈øtained their own garments! What ≈øad bitter things have been upon them, how hath Con≈øcience ri≈øen up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt them! O take heed of the After-claps of Con≈øcience, I may ≈øay, take heed of the Thunder-claps of con≈øcience; for they will come upon you one time or other, if you defile your garments: As they who to plea≈øe
<pb facs="tcp:62760:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>men defile their garments, often fall into their di≈øplea≈øure, who≈øe favour they ≈øought: ≈øo oftentimes ≈øuch fall into di≈øplea≈øure with them≈øelves, or to be ≈øure they ≈øhall at la≈øt: there is many a one lives under the di≈ø-favor of his own con≈øcience, many a one that his con≈øcience will not give him a good word, or a good look, whence hath it been? they have defiled their garments. They who venture to do things di≈øplea≈øing to God, ≈øhall not long be plea≈øing to them≈øelves.</p>
            <p>The ≈øtory ≈øpeaks of <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> that to plea≈øe men, to ≈øave an e≈øtate, he defiled his garments, and he pre≈øently fell into rebuke of him≈øelf, and lived under the rebuke of his con≈øcience a long time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Job</hi> 8.15. ≈øpeaking of the hypocrite, <hi>his hope ≈øhall be cut off,</hi> the word ≈øignifies to loath, ≈øo ≈øome tran≈ølate, <hi>his hope ≈øhall be a loathing to him, he ≈øhall loath his hope.</hi> There is a two-fold loathing: Fir≈øt, a loathing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, that is, a gracious loathing, a loathing our ≈øelves for our ≈øins again≈øt God. And there is a loathing of de≈øpair, and that is the loathing there meant: the Hypocrite ≈øhall loath his own hope, that is, he ≈øhall loath it de≈øpairingly. 'Tis an affliction to be loathed by men, but 'tis a dreadful judgement to be loathed of our ≈øelves de≈øpairingly; this is the ≈øuburbs of Hell, for this will be the portion of the damned for ever, for their vanity, for their madne≈øs, 'tis next to the Regions of Hell, for their Worm dieth not; and than is the Worm of Con≈øcience: Oh therefore, take heed, Con≈øcience may be ≈øilent, yea, it may flatter for a time, but when Con≈øcience is provoked, it will ≈øpeak, yea thunder.</p>
            <p>There is no ≈øuch thundering Preacher in the World as Con≈øcience is, the thundering of Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> is not like the thundering of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and la≈øtly, let it be for exhortation, and encouragement, for Chri≈øt here makes it an encouragement, ≈øo let this be an encouragement to keep our garments undefiled, the remembrance that we ≈øhall walk with him in White, in the White of peace, and joy in this World: who would not walk in this White? who would not be among tho≈øe who keep their garments White in the mid≈øt of a defiled and defiling World?</p>
            <p>Let me give you but a three-fold con≈øideration. To ≈øtir you up to an exceeding exactne≈øs and carefulne≈øs not to defile your garments, ≈øeeing there is ≈øuch a reward promi≈øed, ≈øuch a habit of White promi≈øed, as this White, wherein we ≈øhall walk with Je≈øus Chri≈øt. It is an Angelical hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈øs, ≈øo much Heaven is come down upon ye, while you have this white. 'Tis heaven before heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.3. the Angel that came down to the Sepulchre of Chri≈øt, his Raiment was white as the light. The Martyrs when they had Angelical Apparitious, they always appeared to them in
<pb facs="tcp:62760:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>white; as one upon the Rack thought he felt an Angel ≈øupplying him, while his enemies tormented him.</p>
            <p>Chri≈øt calls the Phari≈øees <hi>whited Sepulchres;</hi> they are whited, but whited Sepulchres, that is a woful condition to be whited like a Sepulchre. Thus it is with tho≈øe who defile them≈øelves, they are whited Walls, and whited Sepulchres. They that keep them≈øelves White, ≈øhall walk in White, ≈øhall have Angelical Glory.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Con≈øider this White, or walking in White, is ≈øuch as conquers all the blackne≈øs of this World: 'tis not po≈ø≈øible for the World to alter the colour of this White, how much dirt ≈øoever they put upon it: this White will be VVhite ≈øtill, they cannot turn it to be black; they cannot take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way this peace, this joy from us; they cannor ≈øtrip us of this habit, they may pull off your fine garments, but you cannot be ≈øtript of this VVhite. <hi>Your joy ≈øhall no man take from you,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.20. <hi>As ≈øorrowful, yet always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet freely po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing all things.</hi> The VVorld may put us into a ≈øad e≈øtate, as to the VVorld, yet we are not out of our white garments, always rejoycing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Fig-tree ≈øhall not blo≈ø≈øome, neither ≈øhall fruit be in the Vines, the labour of the Olive ≈øhall fail, and the fields ≈øhall yield no meat, and the flock ≈øhall be cut off from the fold, and there ≈øhall be no herd in the ≈øtalls, this cannot take away the VVhite garments, no, ≈øaith the Prophet, <hi>Yet will I rejoyce in the Lord, and joy in the God of my Salvation;</hi> 'Tis a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering joy, turns all ≈øorrow into joy, and blackne≈øs to VVhite, therefore keep clean.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Con≈øider this: this VVhite of peace and joy, as 'tis a joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable; ≈øo 'tis that will be with us mo≈øt, when we mo≈øt need it, when VVorldly joys are farthe≈øt from us, then this joy will be near to us; that is a marvellous comfort, to have comfort in its ≈øea≈øon. The Martyrs who have kept them≈øelves VVhite, have had this VVhite, and walkt in this VVhite; but when they have mo≈øt need of it, and come Actually to ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, then they have had mo≈øt of it. This is a ble≈ø≈øed thing! this the Martyrs of Je≈øus Chri≈øt hath given witne≈øs of, although they have had peace and joy in their con≈øciences at other times, yet never ≈øo much as in the hour of temptation. VVhen they have been ca≈øt into the Cole-hou≈øe, they have had white garments, when they have been ca≈øt into pri≈øons and dungeons, how have they rejoyced? 'Tis ≈øaid of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> they were men that kept their garments undefiled, and they had a great deal of peace and joy; when they were put in the flocks and dungeon, then they ≈øung at midnight: what an enlargement of heart had they at that time!</p>
            <p>So in the ≈øtories of ancient and latter times, how have they rejoyced,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>and gone triumphing to the Gibbet? for then Chri≈øt gives mo≈øt of this White. It hath been the u≈øe of per≈øecutors to put filthy garments upon the Martyrs, drawing Pictures of Devils upon them; and as their malice hath ri≈øen to the height (that in the time of ≈øufferings) to make them look like Devils, then the love of Chri≈øt hath ri≈øen to the height, and they have been full of peace and joy at that time; therefore be encouraged to walk with Chri≈øt in this White. This White is an Angelical Habit, 'tis an unconquerable Habit, and 'tis that will be with us mo≈øt when we have mo≈øt need of it. I ≈øhould have added a third, that walking with Chri≈øt is an honour, and 'tis walking in the White of peace and joy.</p>
            <p>So thirdly, 'tis a truth of walking with Chri≈øt in the White of glory, as in the Transfiguration, which was a Type of Heaven, <hi>his Rayment was White, ≈øo as no Fuller on earth was able to whiten it;</hi> and that is it which I might have ≈øpoken of to you, that they who keep their garments unde≈øiled here, ≈øhall be ≈øure of that, to walk with Chri≈øt in glory hereafter. If we ≈øhould mi≈øs of the White of honour, and have not much of the White of joy, yet be ≈øure we ≈øhall walk with Chri≈øt in the White of Glory.</p>
            <p>I would only ≈øay this to you, That as I have from this Text, and many more, laboured to bring poor ≈øouls into a White ≈øtate, to a ≈øtate of Ju≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, to a ≈øtate of Holine≈øs; and as I have been pre≈ø≈øing you to keep your garments White, that you may be in the Habit of White, as your Reward: ≈øo it ≈øhall be the de≈øire and prayers of ray heart, that if I ≈øhould have no more opportunities among you, that as you have been ≈øtirred up to get into this White of Grace, that you and I may meet in the White of Glory, where we ≈øhall never part.</p>
            <p>Here are three Whites: The White of Honour is good, the White of Peace and Joy, is very good, the White of Glory is be≈øt of all; that is the an≈øwer of all our prayers, and that is the i≈ø≈øue of all our working, then we ≈øhall have as much as we can hold for ever.</p>

            <p n="2">2. While we complain of puni≈øhment, we take ≈øins part again≈øt God, we do as it were ju≈øtifie ≈øin, and judge God: God is unrighteous to puni≈øh ≈øuch a ≈øin as this with ≈øuch grievous afflictions.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By complaining we do as it were ≈øummon God to our Bar, to come and give an account of his actions at our Tribunal: What poor mi≈øerable Creatures are we, that in our afflictions are ≈øo far from helping our ≈øelves, that we commonly add to our own mi≈øery?</p>
            <p>No affliction is intollerable till ≈øin come in it.</p>
            <p>The yoke God hath made ea≈øie, we make intollerable, and make God to be our enemy, while he by affliction would become our friend.</p>
            <p>Now this being found not to be the way; that which God coun≈øels and advi≈øes, is:</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p>We can tell what ≈øuch a Drunkard, ≈øuch an unclean per≈øon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath done; but no man ≈øaith, what have I done? my pride, my unthankfulne≈øs, my unfruitfulne≈øs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>So in the Text, <hi>[Do thy fir≈øt works.]</hi> Sin is a departure from God, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance a coming back again to God: Turn thou to him from whom the Children of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> have deeply revolted.

            <p>Apo≈øtacy is the lo≈øs of our <hi>fir≈øt love.

            <p>My Brethren, we have no great cau≈øe to boa≈øt of <hi>Englands fir≈øt love:</hi> Never ≈øo good as it ≈øhould be, yet many can remember when <hi>England</hi> hath been much better than it is.</p>
            <p>Time was, when Doctrines have been more ≈øound, Di≈øcipline more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øed for the ≈øuppre≈ø≈øing of ≈øin and prophanene≈øs. Ordinances kept more pure from ≈øinful mixtures: when <hi>London</hi> kept Sabbaths better than now, loved their godly Mini≈øters more than now, honoured them that were ≈øet over her for their works ≈øake; would have thought nothing too good for a faithful Mini≈øter: when Chri≈øtians loved one another with a dear, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, fervent love: when there was le≈øs complement, but more real love and affection among Chri≈øtians: when Chri≈øtians improved their meetings, conver≈øe, Chri≈øtian Conference, and other ≈øoul duties to better purpo≈øe than now: not to fooli≈øh di≈øputations, or wanton ≈øen≈øual exce≈øs, but to their mutual edification: when they improved their times for comparing their evidences, communicating their experiences, and building up one another in their mo≈øt holy faith: when there was more indu≈øtry in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øors than now, to bring in Converts, when private Chri≈øtians thought it their duty to be ≈øub≈øervient to the works of their Mini≈øters, to bring in others to Chri≈øt, e≈øpecially their family.</p>
            <p>Time was, when more care of young Converts than now, when none could have looked out after Religion, but ≈øome or other ready to lend them their hand, and ≈øhew them the way, explaining it clearly to them;
<pb facs="tcp:62760:24"/>but now young Converts may be ≈ønapt into ≈øeparation and error, and none look after them.</p>
            <p>Time was, when more care of the truly godly <hi>poor;</hi> when error was more odious; when Popery was more hated than now: when the name of a tolleration would have made Chri≈øtians to have trembled; when Chri≈øtians were better acquainted with their Bibles: when more time ≈øpent in ≈øecret prayer: when more tender of one anothers names and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, would heal one anothers reputations, and would ≈øpread the lap of charity over tho≈øe mi≈ø-reports and ≈øcandals that might be ca≈øt upon then: when Chri≈øtians rejoyced more in one anothers good, and mourned in one anothers ≈øufferings: when Chri≈øtians did more earne≈øtly contend for the faith once delivered to the Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh do you not only <hi>your fir≈øt works,</hi> but our <hi>fore-fathers fir≈øt works:</hi> be as zealous for God and his truths, as tender, mutually careful of one another as they.</p>
            <p>Our fears be very great, and truly our provocations be greater: our dangers are great, but our ≈øins greater: yet here is a word, here is matter of encouragement, that yet there is Balm in <hi>Gilead,</hi> Phy≈øick of Chri≈øts own compo≈øition, for the reviving and healing of a back-≈øliding people, Chri≈øtians, Chri≈øt Je≈øus is become your Phy≈øician, he hath pre≈øcribed you a potion made up of the≈øe three ingredients, <hi>Self-reflection, Holy Contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Thorow Reformation.</hi> Chri≈øtiians, now take this Receipt, Chri≈øt advi≈øes you, if you will not, there is no way but one, <hi>Or el≈øe I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy Candle≈øtick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is yet a means or two I find in Scripture for the preventing of threatned ruine that hath been very near, that God hath pre≈øcribed for a people or per≈øon in great danger, when ready to be cut off and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroyed.</p>
            <p>Now that which I would commend to you in reference to what you would beg of God for <hi>England,</hi> is,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, in your addre≈ø≈øing your ≈øelf to God for that mercy your ≈øouls are ≈øet upon, and you wre≈øtle with God for, that you would make ≈øome ≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al vow to God. I find the Saints have done ≈øo, when reduced to great ≈øtraits, not knowing what to do: Thus <hi>Jacob vowed a vow, ≈øaying, If God will be with me, and will keep me on this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and rayment to put on, ≈øo that I come again to my Fathers hou≈øe in peace, then ≈øhall the Lord be my God. And this Stone which I here ≈øet for a pillar, ≈øhall be Gods hou≈øe,</hi> Gen. 28.20, 21, 22. The ≈øpecial thing <hi>Jacob</hi> vows, is, that he would continue in the pure wor≈øhip of his fore-fathers, that he would ≈øtill honour God as his God, in that way he would be wor≈øhipped; the ≈øpecia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:24"/>thing is, that he would build a hou≈øe for the wor≈øhip of God; here he would erect a place of publick wor≈øhip. And thus <hi>I≈ørael vowed a vow unto the Lord, and ≈øaid, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then will I utterly de≈øtroy their Cities,</hi> Numb. 21.2. They vowed they would not ≈øpare any of the enemies of God, if he would deliver them into their hands. Thus <hi>Jeptha, Hannah, David,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Judg.</hi> 11.31. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.11. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 132.1, 2. Certainly in times of great di≈øtre≈øs, 'tis nor improper or uncomely, but that which God may expect and take well, that you make ≈øome ≈øpecial vow, if God would prevent your fears, if God would continue forfeited mercies, dearer to you than your lives, you would ≈øet apart ≈øome ≈øpecial thing for God, ≈øomething for the propagation of the Go≈øpel abroad, for the maintenance of a godly Mini≈øtry at home, for ≈øetting up the preaching of the Go≈øpel in the dark corners of the Kingdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This mu≈øt have ≈øome cautions with it: As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. We mu≈øt be ≈øure our vow be of what is in our own power, we mu≈øt not make vows of that which is none of our own. <hi>I hate robbery for burnt-offerings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We mu≈øt not make a vow to God of that which hath been unju≈øtly or unrighteou≈øly taken away, or with-held from any. 'Tis <hi>Sacriledge</hi> in≈øtead of a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It mu≈øt be of things warrantable and ju≈øtifiable by the Word.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It mu≈øt be of ≈øuch things that we are not bound to do, before vows, by the ≈øtanding obligation of Religion, and of our profe≈ø≈øion: but of ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is in our own choice, that we will voluntarily make a free-will offering of it to God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We mu≈øt take heed that we do not entertain a ≈øuper≈øtitious thought of our own vows, as if we had merited a mercy at Gods hands by our vows: God looks for ≈øome ≈øpecial vow at our hands, that we may ≈øhew how much we prize and value the mercy we would have, that we would be content to part with any thing, though to the half of our e≈øtate for it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another thing I find, is, that in the mean time we ≈øhould do ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by way of extraordinary bounty and charity to the relief of Gods indigent ≈øervants. Thus the Prophet <hi>Daniel:</hi> Wherefore, <hi>O King, let my coun≈øel be acceptable to thee; break off thy ≈øins by righteou≈øne≈øs, and thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities by ≈øhewing mercy to the poor, if it may be a lengthning of thy tranquility,</hi> Dan. 4.27.</p>
            <p>The Prophet advi≈øes him to break off his ≈øins by Righteou≈øne≈øs, there's Reformation: and be≈øides Reformation, that he would do ≈øomething in an extraordinary way to the relief of the <hi>poor. Mercy to the poor,</hi> what's that?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:25"/>Interpreters conceive, by the <hi>poor,</hi> here he under≈øtands <hi>Gods poor,</hi> i.e. the <hi>poor Jews</hi> that were now in the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity: he advi≈øes, he would do ≈øomething by way of ≈øympathy to the <hi>Jews,</hi> to ea≈øe their yoaks and oppre≈ø≈øions: break off thine iniquities by pittying and ≈øhewing mercy to thy poor Captives, under thy power now at this time; take off their yoak; ea≈øe their burdens, and re≈øtore them to their liberties again. Thus do you, and tho≈øe that have been the in≈øtruments of your conver≈øation, or edification, ≈øet apart ≈øomething extraordinary for their relief and ≈øupply: The Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> ≈øeems to advi≈øe this to the King, as it were by way of ≈øatisfaction.</p>
            <p>There be two things in repentance; in wrongs we have done, there mu≈øt be confe≈ø≈øion, and ≈øatisfaction, or re≈øtoration: he ≈øeems to advi≈øe this to make up compleat repentance; namely, to make re≈øtoration and retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what he had injuriou≈øly taken from the <hi>Jews.</hi> Oh then! let me ≈øay, without breach of charity, that what≈øoever, except it be in this ca≈øe of extraordinary ≈øupplies for his <hi>poor,</hi> it will be found but making re≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and ≈øatisfaction. It may be upon a twofold ground.</p>
            <p n="1">1. With ≈øome it may be truly re≈øtitution and re≈øtoration of what he hath taken away by unju≈øt means, God knows how; that's between God and their own ≈øouls; what unlawful means have been u≈øed to augment the heap, and ≈øwell their E≈øtate.</p>
            <p>If there be any that hear me this day, who≈øe con≈øciences ≈øhall tell them that they have increa≈øed their e≈øtate by undue and unwarrantable means; Oh <hi>Re≈øtore, Re≈øtore, break off your iniquities by ≈øhewing mercy,</hi> &amp;c. by making reparation as you can: it will be but like <hi>Zacheus</hi> giving half his goods to the <hi>poor,</hi> and re≈øtoring four-fold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a liberal Contribution to the <hi>poor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It will be re≈øtitution in another ≈øen≈øe, in reference to an unju≈øt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding: ≈øome have injuriou≈øly, and I am afraid too too many have kept injuriou≈øly. Have we not rob'd the <hi>poor</hi> by an unju≈øt denying of what God hath commanded us to di≈øtribute to their nece≈ø≈øties? <hi>there is that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth more than is meet,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.17. and 11.24. It may be God hath given you ≈øo much: there's Gods ≈øhare, there's the Mini≈øters portion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now all that you have with-held beyond the Rule of Scripture, is all ≈øtolen goods, and is like a Wheat-≈øheaf on fire, will burn down the whole Barn of Corn.</p>
            <p>That which I would exhort you to, is, for every one to ≈øet a part ≈øome con≈øiderable part of your E≈øtate, and account it as a hollow thing, dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to God, as a thing, which to touch, were ≈øacriledge; that you may be ready on all occa≈øions, in all regular and due ways, to bring out for
<pb facs="tcp:62760:25"/>the relief of the poor, you know objects abounding in every place, and you may expect warrantable means for di≈øpen≈øing of what God ≈øhall put into your hearts in this matter.</p>

            <p>THe Apo≈øtle in this excellent Chapter, (that by ≈øome is de≈øervedly called a little Book of Martyrs) di≈øcovers the tryumph of faith, or victory again≈øt all difficulty we meet with.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Faith it a≈ø≈øents to truths be they never ≈øo improbable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It puts men upon duties, be they never ≈øo irrational, or again≈øt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal intere≈øt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It enables to ≈øufferings, be they never ≈øo afflictive. The≈øe Worthies went through all by the victory that overcame the world, the bitterne≈øs as well as the ≈øweetne≈øs thereof.</p>
            <p>In the≈øe ver≈øes the Apo≈øtle doth two things: Fir≈øt, he ≈øets down the greatne≈øs and ≈ømartne≈øs of their ≈øufferings, which are by ≈øome learned men reduced to three heads.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, tho≈øe ≈øufferings that were to tempt them, and draw them from God, by tho≈øe pains and tortures they were to undergo.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Tho≈øe ≈øufferings they underwent in dying.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, their ≈øufferings in regard of wandering, and leaving their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, rather than they would lo≈øe God.</p>
            <p>There were all kind of per≈øecutions laid upon the≈øe Saints, through all which they waded, and never would be brought to for≈øake God and his truth, for any of them. 2. We have here the excellency of the ≈øufferers, and that is in that expre≈ø≈øion, <hi>The≈øe men,</hi> or, <hi>the≈øe per≈øons,</hi> when they were under all the≈øe di≈øtre≈ø≈øes from the world, yet they were ≈øuch of whom the world was not worthy.</p>
            <p>Brethren, the excellency of the≈øe ≈øaints and ≈øervants of God is con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able two ways, that we may proceed di≈øtinctly and clearly.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, in reference to the wicked; their excellency was ≈øo great that the wicked World was not worthy of them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, their excellency is di≈øcovered from the e≈øtimate or judgment that the Apo≈øtle pa≈ø≈øes upon them, who tells us, that he accounted them
<pb facs="tcp:62760:26"/>to be ≈øuch; though they were under ≈øuch di≈øtre≈ø≈øes, and troubles, yet they were a people of whom the world was not worthy.</p>
            <p>I ≈øhall fall upon the due e≈øtimation the ble≈ø≈øed Apo≈øtle rai≈øes upon the≈øe per≈øecuted Saints, who was enlightened by the Spirit of God, and ≈øo was able to pa≈øs a right ≈øentence upon the≈øe per≈øecuted Saints; from this I rai≈øe this en≈øuing ob≈øervation.</p>

               <item>Fir≈øt, wherein the high e≈øtimation of a gracious heart does appear, wherein it doth di≈øcover it ≈øelf, wherein they ≈øhew they have ≈øuch an high e≈øtimation.</item>
               <item>Secondly, whence it is, and how it comes to pa≈øs, that Godly men have this high and honourable e≈øteem of the Saints and people of God in their troubles and di≈øtre≈ø≈øes which befall them.</item>
            </list>
            <p>For the fir≈øt, wherein the high e≈øtimation of a gracious heart does ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, I ≈øhall ≈øhew it in five or ≈øix following particulars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Fir≈øt, it appears in this, in that they are not a≈øhamed of owning their per≈øons and faith, that they profe≈øs in their troubles and di≈øtre≈ø≈øes: the ≈øociety of the people of God, and the fellow≈øhip of the faith and profe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, is highly re≈øpected by a gracious heart, let the Saints lie under never ≈øo great di≈øtre≈ø≈øes. This is manife≈øted in <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> in the 25. and 26. ver≈øes of this Chapter; <hi>He cho≈øe rather to ≈øuffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy all the plea≈øures and preferments of</hi> Pharaohs <hi>Court.</hi> The <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the profe≈ø≈øion of the truth of God, and owning the faith and tho≈øe truths the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> ≈øtood up for, this was that which <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øert: and thence it was he did not de≈øert their company and ≈øociety, but went and vi≈øited them when they lay under tho≈øe burthens under which they lay.</item>
               <item>Secondly, the ≈øecond thing wherein is di≈øcovered ≈øo high an e≈øtimation of the Saints and people of God in ≈øuffering, is, their ≈øympathizing and fellow-feeling with them in their ≈øuffering: If it goes ill with the Church and people of God, all the re≈øt ≈øympathize with them; if one member ≈øuffers, all the re≈øt ≈øuffers.

<pb facs="tcp:62760:26"/>becau≈øe of the ≈øufferings of the Saints and people of God, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Wherefore, the King ≈øaid unto me, Why is thy countenance ≈øad, ≈øeeing thou art not ≈øick: This is nothing el≈øe but ≈øorrow of heart. Then I was very ≈øore afraid, and an≈øwered the King, becau≈øe of the di≈øtre≈ø≈øes the people of God lye under.</hi> The plea≈øure of Mu≈øick ≈øhould never be with him ≈øays <hi>David</hi> in P≈øal. 137.6. <hi>If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, If I prefer not</hi> Jeru≈øalem <hi>above my chief joy.</hi> As it is with two ≈øtrings in an in≈øtrument rightly tuned, if one be touched the other trembles: if one ≈øervant of Chri≈øt be in a ≈øuffering condition, the re≈øt ≈øuffers with him: this is the damp of all worldly delight, if it be ill with any of the people of God, the re≈øt ≈øuffers in the way of compa≈ø≈øion.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, in that they can plead for them, and take their parts, when they are never ≈øo much out of favour, when they are never ≈øo much de≈øpi≈øed and abu≈øed: This was in the ca≈øe of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> how he pleaded for poor <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> before his cruel father <hi>Saul,</hi> though <hi>Saul</hi> called him a cur≈øed Son, and fell ≈øoul on his Mother becau≈øe of him. See this in the ca≈øe of <hi>E≈øther,</hi> though it was death to go into the King to plead for the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet for all this ≈øhe ≈øays, <hi>If I peri≈øh, I peri≈øh:</hi> re≈øolved I am, come what will come of it, in I will go, I can dye, but I cannot be ≈øilent.</item>
               <item>Fourthly, in that they will relieve them, and help and ≈øupply them with all needful good things they can, if they cannot do what they would, they will do for them what they can: See this in the ca≈øe of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Chap. 28. v. 8 11, 12, 13. Ebedmelech <hi>went forth of the Kings hou≈øe and ≈øpake to the King‚Äî So</hi> Ebedmelech <hi>took the man with him, and went into the hou≈øe of the King under the Trea≈øury, and took thence old clouts, and old rotten rags and let them down by cords into the Dungeon to</hi> Jeremiah. <hi>And</hi> Ebedmelech <hi>the</hi> Ethiopian <hi>≈øaid unto</hi> Jeremiah, <hi>Put now the≈øe old ca≈øt clouts, and rotten rags under thine arm-holes, under the cords. And</hi> Jeremiah <hi>did ≈øo, So they drew up</hi> Jeremiah <hi>with cords, and took him up out of the Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, &amp;</hi> Jeremiah <hi>remained in the court of the Pri≈øon.</hi> He would never be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et till he got the Prophet out of the Dungeon, and though the cords were lined with rags, yet more with love and this favour of <hi>Ebedmelech,</hi> God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.4. <hi>Obediahs</hi> ma≈øter was not only an oppre≈ø≈øor of the Saints and Prophets of God, but a very great Per≈øecutor: This good man <hi>Obediah</hi> took and hid 400 <hi>Prophets of the Lord, and led them with bread and water:</hi> (I will not undertake to prophe≈øie to you this day, yet time may come when bread and water may be good food for a faithful Prophet.) Here note the gracious di≈øpo≈øition of good <hi>Obediah,</hi> as well as the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God in this act, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18. <hi>The Lord give mercy unto the dou≈øe of</hi> One≈øiphorus, <hi>for be oft refre≈øhed me, and was not a≈øhamed of my chain.
<pb facs="tcp:62760:27"/>But when he was in</hi> Rome, <hi>he ≈øought me out very gently, and found me. The Lord grant unto him, that he may finde mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he mini≈øtred unto me at Ephe≈øus, thou knowe≈øt very well.</hi> A mo≈øt admirable Scripture to this purpo≈øe: ble≈ø≈øed <hi>Paul</hi> being thrown into pri≈øon; being in bonds, <hi>One≈øiphorus</hi> often refre≈øht him, and was not a≈øhamed of his chains: How did he ≈øhew this? When he was in <hi>Rome,</hi> he ≈øought him out diligently. By the way note, That <hi>Rome</hi> was the place where the cruel <hi>Nero</hi> was Emperour, it was the place where much bloud of the Martyrs was ≈øpilt, yet there this good man ≈øought out <hi>Paul</hi> dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genly: Mark what follows, which is the prayer of <hi>Paul, The Lord grant to him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day.</hi> I profe≈øs Sirs, I had rather have the prayer of <hi>Paul,</hi> than the preferments of the greate≈øt Court on earth. Chri≈øtians, it is the greate≈øt trea≈øure in your hou≈øe, to have the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of good men to God for you: you that have ≈øhewn your great and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant love to the Saints and ≈øervants of God in di≈øtre≈øs, I do from my ≈øoul beg the mercy for you, that whatever you have done for his, may be ten thou≈øand times made up by him, that you may finde mercy in that day; and truly Sirs, in that day mercy will be worth receiving.</item>
               <item>Fifthly, They ≈øupplicate to God for them; they do not go to the throne of Grace for them≈øelves, but <hi>Sion</hi> is in their thoughts. I am confident it is ≈øo with ≈øome, and am per≈øwaded it is ≈øo with all; they never beg daily bread for them≈øelves, but they remember <hi>Sion.</hi> In the 51. <hi>P≈øalm David</hi> was under trouble of con≈øcience, ≈øoul-trouble, which is the ≈øoul of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; yet at the latter end of the 51. <hi>P≈øalm</hi> he breaks out into this earne≈øt ≈øupplication to God; <hi>Do good in thy good plea≈øure unto Sion, build thou up the walls of Jeru≈øalem.</hi> So long as it is ill with the people of God, ≈øo long they are earne≈øt with God: and though they cannot overcome men with their prayers (which by the way they are to endeavour) yet they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leave ≈øupplicating the Almighty, till they have overcome. As the ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Gods people are precious in the ≈øight of God, ≈øo they are in the fight of the people of God.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I come now to ≈øhew whence it is, that there is ≈øuch an high e≈øteem in the people of God, of the people of God, when under trouble and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtre≈øs: for this take two heads of rea≈øons.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Fir≈øt, In regard of tho≈øe people of God that do behold their ≈øufferings.</item>
               <item>Secondly, In regard of tho≈øe people of God that are in ≈øufferings.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Fir≈øt, In regard of tho≈øe people of God that do behold their ≈øufferings, troubles, and di≈øtre≈ø≈øes, in three regards.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Fir≈øt, Tho≈øe of the people of God that look upon others in trouble, though they are ≈øuch as may differ from them in regard of outward e≈øtate:
<pb facs="tcp:62760:27"/>one may be in honour, the other in di≈øhonour, yet they have an intere≈øt in the ≈øame head, and do belong to the ≈øame body that they do, they are not wooden legs, not gla≈øs eyes: therefore Chri≈øt is called the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Saviour, and the Saviour of the body, the whole Church: Faith, it is called, the <hi>like precious Faith,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> in the beginning. The Faith of one Believer does as truly lay hold on Chri≈øt, as the Faith of another. This Salvation is called common ≈øalvation: my meaning is, this outward di≈øproportion as the birth and education, puts no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at all in a ≈øpiritual re≈øpect between Believer and Believer: a King and a Beggar are all one in Chri≈øt; a Jew, or a Greek, a great Scholar or a poor ignorant man, as to the ≈øpiritual ≈øtate, all are made happy the ≈øame way.</item>
               <item>Secondly, becau≈øe the≈øe look at Spiritual excellency, and are able to di≈øcern Spiritual excellency: they have a renewed judgement, as they look upon their old cour≈øes and ≈øins with a new eye, ≈øo they look upon their company with a new eye: tho≈øe that before they highly e≈øteemed, they now di≈ø-e≈øteem: tho≈øe per≈øons that before they e≈øteemed a damp to their mirth, they now look upon them as the excellent ones of the earth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.26. <hi>The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour.</hi> In the ≈øixteenth p≈øalm, ≈øays <hi>David, My goodne≈øs extends not to thee, but to the Saints, the excellent ones, in whom is all my delight.</hi> Here was a renewed e≈øtimation; <hi>David</hi> ≈øaw excellency in tho≈øe which Worldlings de≈øpi≈øed. A carnal eye ≈øees no glory but in carnal objects: Worldlings ble≈øs the covetous, whom the Lord abhors. A gracious heart ≈øees a ≈øpiritual worth in a man deve≈øted of worldly enjoyments, as a curious eye may, and does ≈øee a great deal of Art and curio≈øity in a Picture, though in a broken frame. A bea≈øt can ≈øee the ≈øhining of a Diamond, but knows not the worth of it: A Bea≈øt will rather lick up a lock of hay, than a Diamond, though of never ≈øo great value. A wicked man wants a ≈øpirit of di≈øcerning. The people of God are the workman≈øhip of God, which a godly man is very much taken withal, not with the greatne≈øs, but with the goodne≈øs that is in them. The four Monarchs of the earth is expre≈øt by four Bea≈øts, which ≈øhews their cruelty, not their curio≈øity, in ob≈øerving that of God which may be ob≈øerved. A Child is taken with the Gay, but a learned man is taken with the learning and art of a Le≈ø≈øon.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, A Child of God is one that highly e≈øteems the people of God, judging of them as God judges. The child e≈øteems as the father e≈øteems: if the father cannot love any one, the ingenious Child cannot endure that he ≈øhould come into the Hou≈øe. The Courtier follows the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
<pb facs="tcp:62760:28"/>of the King; whom the King honours, they cringe to. But to be ≈øure it is true as to ≈øpirituals: God judges not by the Gold Ring, or Silken ≈øuit: a ≈øinner is a vile per≈øon in Gods account, and ≈øo he is in a godly mans account: God is more taken with a broken hearted ≈øigh, then with all the gaudery in <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple. He did not chu≈øe the Eagle, or Lyon for Sacrifice, but the Lamb and the Dove: not many noble, not many rich, but the poor hath God cho≈øen: he that hath the choice of God, hath the life of God.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The ≈øecond Rea≈øon is from the people of God that are beheld. And this will appear in five or ≈øix particulars.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, The people of God, tho≈øe that are truly ≈øuch, let their pre≈øent condition be what it will, their end ≈øhall be happy. Men are not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in reference to what they have in <hi>po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion,</hi> but what they ≈øhall have in <hi>rever≈øion:</hi> the poor here are rich in Faith, and ≈øhall be rich in Glory, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. The people of God are Heirs of Glory, co-heirs with Chri≈øt: when he ≈øhall <hi>appear,</hi> they ≈øhall <hi>appear</hi> with him in Glory: they are not po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øors here, but they are heirs; and are to be look'd upon as what they ≈øhall be hereafter: Here they are Princes going to their Crown, hereafter they ≈øhall be <hi>po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed</hi> of it: Here they may be oppre≈ø≈øed, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh'd, disgrac'd, libell'd, hereafter they ≈øhall ≈øhine as the Sun in glory.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They are not only ≈øuch as ≈øhall be happy, but they are very u≈øeful and beneficial in the world; they are tho≈øe, for who≈øe ≈øake the world was made, they are the great common ble≈ø≈øings of the World, like fire and water, they are tho≈øe for who≈øe ≈øake God ≈øpares the world. If God would have ≈øpared the City for ten <hi>righteous</hi> per≈øons ≈øakes, ≈øure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for many tens God ≈øpares the world; tho≈øe that are pulled down by the world, are tho≈øe for who≈øe ≈øake God doth not pull down the world; they are the ≈øoul of the world, as I may ≈øo ≈øay: If God hath gathered in all his Elect, the world would not continue one hour longer.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the excellency of their <hi>performances</hi> is highly e≈øteemed, there is a worth in every holy work that worldlings are not able to di≈øcern; every heavenly <hi>Prayer,</hi> and ≈øincerely be≈øtowed Alms, hath a worth that a carnal man doth not ≈øee. <hi>Luther</hi> ≈øayes, <hi>I had rather do the lea≈øt truly good work, than obtain all the Conque≈øts of</hi> Cae≈øar <hi>and</hi> Alexander: If their good works ≈øhall be ≈øo rewarded, do you think a holy man can ≈øee them and not be taken with them? Many a wicked man when he hears a holy man make an excellent <hi>Oration,</hi> wi≈øhes that he could do ≈øo too, it is not from the goodne≈øs he ob≈øerves in it, or the principle from whence it comes, but from ≈øomething of natural accompli≈øhments that he is taken with it; ≈øo a godly man when he hears another pray excellently, and
<pb facs="tcp:62760:28"/>live holily, he wi≈øhes from his heart that he could do ≈øo too, his aim is to grow in holine≈øs.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The pre≈øent priviledges of the people of God, not onely what they ≈øhall have hereafter, but what they have here, they are freed from a world of evils that worldlings lie under, whatever befals them turns to their benefit; they may be afflicted, but not hurt by affliction; the greate≈øt hurt the world does to them; tends to their greate≈øt good. Worldlings may take away their heads, they cannot their crowns: there is a real communication of a ble≈ø≈øed intere≈øt in all that is good, for they have an intere≈øt in all that God hath, or is; the power of God is theirs to protect them, the love of God is ≈øet upon them, the righteou≈øne≈øs of God imputed to them, ≈øo as to acquit them from ≈øin; ≈øo that a Child of God may not onely appeal to the bowels of Gods mercy, but to the bar of his ju≈øtice, all the providences of God ≈øhall tend to their good. In <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 25.10. the Holy Gho≈øt ≈øays, <hi>All the ways of God are mercy and truth, to them that are in covenant with him:</hi> they are mercy, becau≈øe they are appointed to do them good; and truth, becau≈øe they ≈øhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly do them good: Chri≈øt, and God, and all is laid out for the good of a godly man.</p>
            <p>In this world they may go to God, and tell him wherein they are troubled, pained, or afflicted, and they are never more welcome then when they ask mo≈øt from him; if thou ask great things from God, God is well taken with ≈øuch reque≈øts; but if thou ask Riches and Honours, the≈øe are the low things of the foot-≈øtool: God is exceedingly taken with thee when thou aske≈øt Peace and Pardon, Peace of Con≈øcience, Pardon of ≈øin, ≈øtrength again≈øt ≈øin, power to overcome thy Lu≈øts, to with≈øtand temptations. The people of God may have from God all that they want, and all that they can regularly wi≈øh.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The≈øe are ≈øuch as have an incomparable dear and near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to God; they are his delight, they are ≈øet apart by God as his own, his peculiar people: though God have a propriety in all, yet he hath a peculiar propriety in, and a relation to the≈øe; therefore they are called his children, his hou≈øe, his jewels, his garden: Gods whole trea≈øure and portion is his people; as God is his peoples portion, ≈øo his people are his portion; they are tho≈øe he hath been at a great deal of co≈øt to purcha≈øe.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, They are ≈øuch as have the <hi>image of God</hi> imprinted upon them; take notice of this word <hi>image,</hi> for the image of God appears in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs: Now an image does not repre≈øent any thing of imperfection or deformity, but of excellency. If a man takes the picture of a man, he will not take it of his back-≈øide, or leg, or hand, or the like, but of his
<pb facs="tcp:62760:29"/>face, his beautifulle≈øt part is chiefly aimed at in the picture. Wicked <hi>men</hi> di≈øcover Gods bounty in having wit and wealth; this is not the image of God; the image of God is that which is mo≈øt excellent in a man, which is holine≈øs: the power of God is the hand of God, the wi≈ødom of God is the eye of <hi>God,</hi> the holine≈øs of <hi>God</hi> is the face, the beauty of <hi>God;</hi> the people of God re≈øemble God in purity. <hi>Be ye holy, as your heavenly Father is holy,</hi> there's the pattern, they have the Divine Nature: 2 Pet. 1.4. <hi>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promi≈øes, that by the≈øe you might be partakers of the Divine Nature, having e≈øcaped the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption that is in the world;</hi> as it is in Ephe≈ø. 4.18. <hi>Having the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding darkned, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, becau≈øe of the blindne≈øs of their heart:</hi> Rom. 3.23. <hi>For all have ≈øinned, and come ≈øhort of the glory of God.</hi> There is more of God in grace, then in all the works that ever God did in the world be≈øide: there is much of God ≈øeen in making the Sun, Moon, and Stars; but in giving a man a new nature, a renewed under≈øtanding, in changing of a man from being a ve≈ø≈øel of wrath and ve≈ø≈øel of Satan, in making of him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a new man, a ve≈ø≈øel of glory, God ≈øhews more of him≈øelf, then in making ten thou≈øand worlds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øe.</hi> Here I ≈øhall rai≈øe the≈øe following inferences. If it be ≈øo, that there is ≈øuch an excellency in the people of God here, then fir≈øt, what excellency ≈øhall there be ≈øeen on the people of God in heaven? If they are ≈øo beautiful in their Rags, what will they be when they appear in their Robes? The glory of Chri≈øt ≈øhall be admired in them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. Oh what a Head is he that hath ≈øuch Members? what a Lord is he that hath ≈øuch attendance? The people of God are in a ≈øtate of non-appearance now, hereafter it ≈øhall appear what they are; the very wicked them≈øelves ≈øhall admire them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Inference. What have we to think of tho≈øe that have no regard ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Religion, or for Religious ones, any farther forth then it is deck'd and adorned with advantagious beauty, and outward glory? If Religion be not lookt upon with a favourable eye from Authority, fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel Religion, and Religiou≈øne≈øs. The≈øe love the child for the Nur≈øes ≈øake; what is the thing in fa≈øhion the≈øe are for; what Authority com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, they'll creep and cringe to, when the Deer is ≈øhot, the Herd flies from her; when Religion is ≈øhot at, then farewell Religion. What is this but to have the Faith of God in re≈øpect of per≈øons? If I love Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion for the countenance of Authority, then it is certain I love Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion for the Authorities ≈øake: this is a ≈øign thou ≈øhalt not have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with tho≈øe hereafter, that thou contemne≈øt here. If the people
<pb facs="tcp:62760:29"/>of God are too bad for thee when they are in trouble and affliction, they will be too good for thee in glory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Inference. Note here the excellency of holine≈øs above worldly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Here a man is dignified by what is conferr'd upon him; when out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward honour cea≈øeth, the man is contemned; but holine≈øs it dignifies a man, and ≈øhall remain here and hereafter. Set a Gyant in a valley, he is a Gyant ≈øtill, a Pearl is a Pearl though on a Dunghil; a holy man is a holy man, though never ≈øo much di≈øgrac'd and contemned by men. <hi>John Bapti≈øt</hi> had a leathern girdle, and had locu≈øts for his food, yet there was not a greater than <hi>John Bapti≈øt</hi> born of women: He was the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of Chri≈øt, the friend of the Bridegroom. On the other ≈øide, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi> that was like the voice of God, and not of man, what was he in <hi>Gods</hi> account? the Angel ≈ømote him, and he became worms-meat. There is a ≈øilent dignity in reproached piety, and a ≈øilent ignominy in advanced iniquity. As it was with Chri≈øt, ≈øo it is with the ≈øervants of Chri≈øt; when he was on earth, no man had more ignominy poured upon him; yet there was a ≈øecret glory attended him in all that befel him: though born in a manger, yet wor≈øhipped there: ≈øometimes he was driven to be hungry, the fi≈øh brought him money: ≈øometimes a weary, at that very time converts a woman; ≈øometimes laid hold on by his enemies, at that very time his enemies fell down before him. Look through the whole cour≈øe of his life, there was a ≈øecret glory under all ignominy: Ju≈øt thus it is with the ≈øervants of Chri≈øt, they are in trouble &amp; di≈øgrace, but there is a ≈øecret glory &amp; dignity ≈øhines in them, the Spirit of God &amp; of glory re≈øts upon them: <hi>If ye ≈øuffer for righteou≈øne≈øs ≈øake, ble≈ø≈øed are ye.</hi> To be in high place, and yet to be a Drunkard, a Swearer, a Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma≈øter, or Prophane, this ≈øpoils all thy glory, be thou never ≈øo high.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Inference. This is the way for a man to have a <hi>good name:</hi> would≈øt thou gain a <hi>good report</hi> living and dying? Take heed of ≈øin, take heed of di≈øhonouring God; then God will have thee in everla≈øting remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Inference. Note here the certain happine≈øs of tho≈øe beholders, that do ≈øee certain excellency in holine≈øs, though di≈øgrac'd &amp; under valu'd; if there be any thing in the world that is a ≈øign of ≈øincerity, it is this, to love holine≈øs when di≈øgrac'd, abu≈øed, and ≈øpit upon; to cro≈øs the ≈øtream, and thwart the multitude, is a ≈øign of the truth of grace, and ≈øtrength of grace: this is a ≈øign of true ≈øight, and ≈øtrong ≈øight. To ≈øee beauty in a godly man in ≈øufferings, the <hi>Lord</hi> will certainly have an eye upon thee in <hi>times of trouble.</hi> Here is <hi>comfort</hi> in thine infirmities. Do≈øt thou love ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈øs when compa≈ø≈øed about with ≈øufferings and per≈øecution? God will
<pb facs="tcp:62760:30"/>take notice of thy grace, though compa≈ø≈øed about with abundance of infirmities; the Lord will take notice of a little of his, in a great deal of ours. Here's comfort in ≈øufferings; if you regard his in their ≈øuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the Lord will remember you in your ≈øufferings; the Lord will remember what thou did≈øt for ≈øuch and ≈øuch a ≈øervant of his own in trouble or di≈øtre≈øs. God doth not ca≈øt away any in their lowne≈øs, that have kept clofe to him in their highne≈øs; and this will be comfort in inward trouble, when thou can≈øt find nothing from which to fetch comfort. And this will be comfort in the la≈øt day; though we can ≈øay nothing in that day, by way of merit, yet will it be comfort to be able ≈øincerely to ≈øay that thou ha≈øt owned God and his people in the mid≈øt of ≈øufferings. Do ye think that Judge would not ≈øave that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor that had ≈øaved the life of his wife? If thou ha≈øt owned Chri≈øt when he was in his Rags, do not fear but he will own thee when he comes in his Robes.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Inference and la≈øt, The people of God ≈øhould learn not to be di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged under any mi≈øery or affliction that can befal them in this world; at this very time God hath a high e≈øteem of you; at this time you are his delight, his Garden, his Spou≈øe. The Saints of God are the wi≈øe men of the world, they have cho≈øen that which cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them: I profe≈øs, Sirs, the love of one Saint makes amends for all the hatred you undergo for ≈øinners: the very wicked them≈øelves have a good opinion of you, when you do not ba≈øely comply; their Con≈øciences cannot but have an high e≈øteem of you, when peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their tongues might ≈øpeak again≈øt you. If all this will not do, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, your own con≈øciences are more than a thou≈øand witne≈ø≈øes for you, will then comfort you: no man is a mi≈øerable man for any thing in the world that is done to him, or ≈øaid of him: No, it is a good Con≈øcience that will give the be≈øt acquittance; for thee to have the whole number of Gods people to look upon thee as an unworthy wretch, and as a vile per≈øon, I look upon it as a greater ignominy and di≈øgrace, then to have all the di≈øgraces of wicked men ca≈øt upon thee: That man that hath a godly man to be afraid of him, had need to he very much afraid of him≈øelf. I ≈øhall conclude all with this one word, There is great rea≈øon to look narrowly to your hearts and ways, when they ≈øtand at a di≈øtance from you, and are afraid to come near you.</p>

               <q>And the Angel of the Lord appeard unto him in a flame of fire out of the mid≈øt of a bu≈øh, and he looked, and behold, the bu≈øh burned with fire, and the bu≈øh was not con≈øumed.

And when the Lord ≈øaw that he turned a≈øide to ≈øee, God called unto him out of the mid≈øt of the bu≈øh, and ≈øaid, Mo≈øes, Mo≈øes, And he ≈øaid, Here am I.

            <list>
               <item>1. An <hi>Apparition</hi> that is here pre≈øented to the view of <hi>Mo≈øes, a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though not a con≈øumed bu≈øh.</hi>

               <item>3. Gods Monitory Precept, or Admonition, which he afforded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> when he was drawing near to ≈øee this wonder, in which we have principally con≈øidered two parts.
<list>
                     <item>1. This Precept propounded.
<list>
                           <item>1. Negatively, <hi>That he ≈øhould not draw near.</hi>
                           </item>

You have con≈øiderable the Rea≈øon or Argument, whereby God doth back this Precept or Admonition, <hi>i.e. becau≈øe the place whereon he ≈øtood was holy ground.</hi> The time would fail me if I ≈øhould go over all the≈øe parts, we ≈øhall onely touch on the two former. The <hi>Apparition</hi> which <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> ≈øaw, and <hi>Mo≈øes</hi>'s de≈øire to ob≈øerve it: of the fir≈øt I ≈øhall onely ≈øpeak tran≈øitorily, and in≈øi≈øt on the latter more fully, which I chiefly intend.</item>

               <pb facs="tcp:62760:31"/>1. For the Apparition, or emblematical di≈øcovery of the e≈øtate of the Church in the <hi>burning,</hi> and yet uncon≈øumed <hi>Bu≈øh.</hi> And herein take notice of three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The lowne≈øs and weakne≈øs of the Church, repre≈øented by a <hi>Bu≈øh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The cruelty of the Churches enemies, ≈øignified and repre≈øented by <hi>Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The eminency of its pre≈øervation, though in the <hi>Fire,</hi> yet <hi>uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumed</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in this only take notice, that the <hi>Church</hi> is compared to a <hi>Bu≈øh,</hi> for two rea≈øons:
<list>
                  <item>1. In regard of its deformity and blackne≈øs, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comeline≈øs.</item>
                  <item>2. In regard of its weakne≈øs and brittlene≈øs.</item>
               </list> The <hi>Church</hi> is uncomely in regard of ≈øin, and weak in regard of ≈øuffering; and God ≈øees it be≈øt that it ≈øhould be thus with them to humble them, and to ≈øhew his goodne≈øs to accept them, and to love them; and make them long for their future beauty: and hereby <hi>God</hi> makes them more conformable to their Head, hereby he makes them endeavour to look after inward beauty and glory: hereby he puts them on a life of faith, and takes them off from living by ≈øen≈øe, and creature-comforts, and from being intangled with creature-comforts. And hereby he ≈øhews how little he regards the beauty and glory of this life, which he denies to the be≈øt of his people: And hereby he ≈øhows, that there is a better ≈øtate of appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and glory approaching: and therefore the people of God are not to be cen≈øured under their blackne≈øs and deformity, either in regard of fin or ≈øuffering: their happine≈øs is not to be judged by its outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance: becau≈øe this life is but the ob≈øcurity of the Church: we ≈øee them like the <hi>Tents of Kedar,</hi> but we do not ≈øee how like the <hi>Curtains of Solomon they ≈øhall be.</hi> 2. The people of God ≈øhould take heed of expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that glory of this world, which is not promi≈øed to them, and to ≈øet their hearts on heaven. And you may ≈øee the rea≈øon why wicked men ≈øtumble ≈øo much at the out≈øide of Gods wor≈øhip, becau≈øe there is no <hi>outward bravery and beauty</hi> to allure them to the true wor≈øhip.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Church is compared to a <hi>Bu≈øh,</hi> in regard of its <hi>weakne≈øs</hi> and <hi>brittlene≈øs.</hi> Note, that it is not compared to a ≈øtrong ≈øturdy Oak, but to a weak brittle Bu≈øh. God loves to bring his Church into a low e≈øtate and weak <hi>condition;</hi> as it is here compared to a <hi>Bu≈øh,</hi> ≈øo other-where to a <hi>Vine,</hi> a <hi>Dove,</hi> a <hi>Lamb,</hi> and a <hi>Sheep,</hi> all weak creatures. Sometimes the Church is ≈øaid to be fatherle≈øs and de≈øtitute; and as our <hi>Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt</hi> the head of the Church, was ≈øaid to be weak, <hi>a worm, and no man;</hi> and as the Apo≈øtle ≈øaid, <hi>≈øuffered through weakne≈øs.</hi> And this makes them to tru≈øt in God, and puts them to re≈øt on his ≈øtrength; <hi>When we are
<pb facs="tcp:62760:31"/>weak, then we are ≈øtrong;</hi> outward weakne≈øs will make us look the more to Chri≈øt for ≈øpiritual ≈øtrength; the weakne≈øs of our ≈øtate doth ≈øhew the ≈øpiritual ≈øtrength God gives to his people for the upholding of them. And this weakne≈øs of his Church doth exceedingly confound his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, when ≈øo weak a company ≈øhall be delivered, not only again≈øt, but by the ≈øtrength of men: and hereby God doth gain to him≈øelf the greater glory in their deliverance, for remembring them in their weak e≈øtate. Hereby the people of God are made the more thankful, both for their pre≈øervation in, and deliverance from their powerful adver≈øaries. You ≈øee, here is a large field opened unto me, for the di≈øcour≈øing upon the Churches weakne≈øs, which whether it be more ≈øuitable to the Text, or to the Times, I leave to you to judge.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Con≈øider the cruelty of their oppo≈øition, that is ≈øet forth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øented <hi>by the fire that burned in the Bu≈øh. Afflictions,</hi> and e≈øpecially per≈øecuting ones, are in the Scripture frequently ≈øet out by fire, as, <hi>The fiery tryal, the fire of afflictions.</hi> This doth not only di≈øcover the rage and cruelty of men, but al≈øo the benefit and utility that comes to the Church by affliction: for the afflictions of the Church are not as <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuming,</hi> but <hi>trying fire:</hi> as the fire in the furnace is to Gold, it only takes away the dro≈øs: not like the fire of <hi>Hell,</hi> which hath heat without light, but the School of per≈øecution hath light as well as heat; the School of affliction is the School of teaching. God teacheth his Saints excellent Le≈ø≈øons by the light of that fire. But I pa≈øs by that, I might now in≈øi≈øt upon the third thing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Con≈øider the eminence of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>re≈øervation, <hi>It was not con≈øumed;</hi> the Church of God was hot, but not altogether and wholly con≈øumed: let the fire be never ≈øo hot and ≈øpreading, the Church of God ≈øhall have a being: if the Church be le≈øs in one place, it will be greater in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; what it loo≈øes in one place, it gets in another: And God will have a Name among his people on earth: A man may as well attempt to blow out the light of the Sun with a pair of bellows, or batter it with ≈ønow-balls, as to root the Church out of the world; for it is impo≈ø≈øible to root Chri≈øts Church out of the world. And if you take notice of particular Believers, <hi>it is not con≈øumed</hi> in a way of hurting and de≈øtroying them; and con≈øider, their graces are not con≈øumed, their welfare is not de≈øtroyed: this fire cannot burn them up, though it burn upon them: but as he will mitigate and allay the fire, ≈øo as that it ≈øhall not decrea≈øe their ≈øtrength, ≈øo he will clean≈øe his people by the fire, ≈øo as it ≈øhall burn up nothing but their dro≈øs, and what makes them offen≈øive unto God, &amp; what may make them hurtful to one another. But I pa≈øs by the≈øe things to the ≈øecond general Part, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:32"/>2. <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> care to ob≈øerve Gods admonition, <hi>That he would turn a≈øide and ≈øee this great ≈øight, why the Bu≈øh was not burnt. Mo≈øes</hi> was an excellent Naturali≈øt, and yet here he was po≈øed; he could ≈øee no rea≈øon in nature by all the learning of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> how this thing ≈øhould come to pa≈øs, that a flaming fire ≈øhould be in a brittle Bu≈øh, and yet the Bu≈øh not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumed: And yet I do not conceive (as ≈øome Je≈øuitical Expo≈øitors upon the place do) that <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> did turn a≈øide ≈øo much out of curio≈øity, as to under≈øtand what it was that God did intend by it, and would have him to learn by it. And doubtle≈øs when Gods works are great, our ob≈øervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ≈øhould not be ≈ømall; when his providence is eminently lifted up, we ≈øhould not be ca≈øt down; when the hand of God is upon us, we mu≈øt not ≈øhut our eyes. I am very far from being a Fanatick, and to give credit, or be led by un≈øcriptural Revelations; but yet let me tell you, the times wherein we live are ≈øtrange times, in regard of <hi>≈øtrange ≈øights</hi> and <hi>appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and I que≈øtion if there have not been ≈øome as wonderful as this in our times; but I ≈øhall not now mention them; though it be a forfeiture of your mode≈øty to give a rea≈øon for them, yet they do portend ≈øome ≈øtrange things; the hand of God is not to be neglected, though it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be perfectly conceived; and it is the nature of a wicked man to have <hi>Gods work far out of his ≈øight;</hi> be ≈øure to lay them up in your hearts. And thus far you may take notice of them, To tru≈øt the God that hath all the elementary <hi>Meteors</hi> in his power, and at his command; and this learn, to tremble and dread before that God that hath you in his power, and can do with you and all other things, as he plea≈øes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You have here con≈øiderable, the admonition of God, or the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitory Precept God lays down to <hi>Mo≈øes, i. e.</hi> he forbids him to <hi>draw nigher,</hi> and then bids him to <hi>pull off his ≈øhooes:</hi> the rea≈øon of the former will be ea≈øily under≈øtood in the opening of the latter: I ≈øhall therefore in it briefly take notice of two things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. An Injunction, <hi>Put off thy ≈øhooes.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. The Argument whereby he doth back this, <hi>Becau≈øe the place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he ≈øtood was holy ground.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>For the opening of the former, the Injunction, <hi>Put off thy ≈øhooes,</hi> I ≈øhall not give the divers glo≈ø≈øes, and divers interpretations, which men, with more wit than weight, have endeavoured to make of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the plain meaning is this, which is given us by <hi>Theodoret, Put off thy ≈øhooes,</hi> Gods ≈øcope, and drift, and intent hereby was, to require of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes</hi> reverence, when he was to receive a me≈ø≈øage of very great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and importance about his Church; the de≈øign of God was in this, to prepare him to obedience, therefore God required that of him then,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:32"/>which ≈øervants were wont to do when they came to their Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter, to ≈øhew their reverence to them: Servants u≈øe to come bare-foot to their Ma≈øters, to te≈øtifie reverence to the commands of them on whom they waited: <hi>Nudare pedes ≈øignum reverentiae.</hi> And the putting on the ≈øhooes is in Scripture, as well as among other Writers, held a token of denomination or ma≈øterly power. Hence ≈øome conceive, <hi>John</hi> ≈øpake of Chri≈øt, as one that had his ≈øhooes on; and of him≈øelf, as one that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to unite his ≈øhooes. And the prophet <hi>I≈øaiah,</hi> by a ≈øign of <hi>putting off his ≈øhoes,</hi> is commanded by God to put off his ≈øhoes from off his feet, and to walk naked and bare-foot, and he did ≈øo, <hi>I≈øai.</hi> 20.2. which deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the ≈øervility of the people, in token that Gods people were to be in a low condition in captivity. So we read of Mourners, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.17. <hi>that were of a low ≈øpirit,</hi> they are ≈øaid <hi>to go without ≈øhoes,</hi> or <hi>un≈øhod.</hi> And my Brethren, on the other ≈øide, when God would ≈øhew the freedom of his people, and their deliverance from ≈øervitude, he is ≈øaid to <hi>put ≈øhoes on their feet, Ezek.</hi> 16.10. and the reception of the Prodigal into his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hou≈øe, and the freedom and priviledge his father intended him, (according to ≈øome learned men, intended by that expre≈ø≈øion in <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.22.) is ≈øet forth by putting on ≈øhoes upon his feet. So that I take the meaning of this command to be ≈øo much; Shew by this thy reverence, thy humility, thy due ≈øubmi≈ø≈øivene≈øs, thy ≈øubjection of ≈øpirit, together with thy ≈øervile readine≈øs to do what≈øoever I ≈øhall command thee. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> hath this Note upon the Text: <hi>If ≈øo excellent a ≈øervant of God as</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, <hi>had need to be quickened to reverence and obedience by ≈øuch a Ceremony, certainly we that are more backward to humility and obedience, ≈øhould by our reverent behaviour, when we come into the pre≈øence of God, ≈øignifie both the reverence of our ≈øouls by our outward expre≈ø≈øions, and likewi≈øe quicken and fortifie the inward graces of our ≈øouls by the inward ge≈øtures of the body; e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in prayer, as kneeling, and lifting up the hands, uncovering of the head, and the like: for the pre≈øence of God is great, and it's the pre≈øence of the great God indeed.</hi> We that are not onely by the Law of Creation, ≈øo infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly below him, but al≈øo in regard of that illegal Law of ≈øin, ≈øo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt him, ≈øhould te≈øtifie our humility before him, and ≈øubjection to him, when he calls for it by our reverence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The rea≈øon by which this is backt, <hi>Becau≈øe the place whereon Mo≈øes did ≈øtand, was holy ground.</hi> The meaning I take to be this, it is holy in regard of that vi≈øible and miraculous token, ≈øymbol, and ≈øign of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence, that is here di≈øcovered in this place; not becau≈øe the place was (as I do not under≈øtand how any place is) of its own nature holy, but God
<pb facs="tcp:62760:33"/>did te≈øtifie, that the place being the place of his ≈øpecial pre≈øence, had thereby a holine≈øs; there being now a ≈øign given by God to <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> that he was extraordinarily and miraculou≈øly there. And thus I have opened the ≈øecond Branch, whereon this Injunction was backt, <hi>This place was holy;</hi> ≈øo it was then. Now I do not under≈øtand how I can di≈øcour≈øe of this ≈øo profitably unto you, concerning the holine≈øs of places, unle≈øs we take notice of the holine≈øs of places in the time of the Go≈øpel, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider, whether, and how in the≈øe times, one place may be ≈øaid to be holy, or holier then another. And truly I am not put on this employment willingly, nor the handling of this ≈øubject; and if it were not extorted from me by ≈øomething, I do not ≈øay that I have ≈øeen, but that I have read, that was written by men, and tho≈øe none of the meane≈øt neither, the learned≈øt of the Papi≈øts, I ≈øhould not now have cho≈øen to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon this Task, concerning the holine≈øs of places; in oppo≈øition to whom, I have entred upon this Di≈øcour≈øe: I will give you expre≈ø≈øions, which one of the devoute≈øt, and the other of the learned≈øt of them hath: the learned≈øt of them, accounted ≈øo at lea≈øt, (though ble≈ø≈øed be God, his weapons have not been formidable to the Church) is <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> his words are the≈øe: <hi>Templum con≈øecrandum merito venerabile &amp; divina vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute preaeditum e≈øt:</hi> The Temple con≈øecrated is de≈øervedly holy, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable in wor≈øhip, and endowed with divine vertue and efficacy; the Temple ought to be looked upon as honourable and venerable. And for the other, <hi>Durandus</hi> he tells us; <hi>So great is the Religion and holine≈øs of Churches, that tho≈øe things ≈øhould be, and may be forbidden to be done in them,</hi> (he means perpetually, or el≈øe he ≈øaid nothing, for we grant as much) <hi>which in other places may duly and lawfully be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the handling of this que≈øtion, <hi>How are we to judge and conceive of the holine≈øs of places, in the time of the Go≈øpel?</hi> I ≈øhall endeavour, fir≈øt, to explain it, and then faithfully and truly endeavour to re≈øolve and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the ≈øame.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt then, for explanation, I ≈øhall here endeavour to open the≈øe two things to you: fir≈øt, what it is for a place to be holy, or wherein the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the holine≈øs of the places con≈øi≈øts; ≈øecondly, what that is, that is foundation or cau≈øe of the holine≈øs of places; and both the≈øe mu≈øt in our di≈øcour≈øe, and likewi≈øe apprehen≈øion, be accurately di≈øtingui≈øht.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What it is for a place to be holy, this is two ways to be con≈øidered:
<list>
                  <item>1. Generally;</item>
                  <item>2. More particularly.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. More generally, The holine≈øs of a place doth con≈øi≈øt in the ≈øepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, the ≈øetting it apart, the di≈øtinction and di≈øcrimination in the way of ≈øome excellent pre-eminence, or the exalting of it before and
<pb facs="tcp:62760:33"/>above all other places. Thus the notion of the holine≈øs of places is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in Scripture, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.31, 37, 38. you ≈øhall there read, that the Lord tells them in the 31 ver≈øe, concerning the ointment that he pre≈øcribed, and likewi≈øe the compo≈øition of it for his ≈øervice: <hi>This ≈øhall be an holy anointing oyl unto me throughout your generations.</hi> Now ≈øee how God doth di≈øcover this to be holy; <hi>On mans fle≈øh it ≈øhall not be poured, neither ≈øha-you make any other like it, after the compo≈øition of it.</hi> Here was a di≈øcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as well to the u≈øing of it, as to the making and compo≈øition of it; as none was to make ≈øuch an oyntment as this was, ≈øo none was to u≈øe it in their ordinary and common employment, ≈øo that now the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈øs thereof did con≈øi≈øt in the di≈øtinction &amp; di≈øcrimination of it from other u≈øes, and likewi≈øe from all other oyntment. And this is further expre≈ø≈øed concerning the <hi>holy perfumes,</hi> in the 37 and 38 <hi>ver≈øes,</hi> there was to be a difference betwixt this and other perfume; and this was the holine≈øs thereof. And ≈øo you ≈øhall find it not only concerning holy things, but likewi≈øe concerning holy per≈øons, <hi>Lev.</hi> 20.24, 25. <hi>I am the Lord your God, which have ≈øeparated you from other people; you ≈øhall therefore put a difference between clean bea≈øts, and unelean.</hi> Mark ye, herein is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈øs of the people, that they were a differenced and ≈øevered people. And hence it is you read in <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.18, 19. that God is there ≈øaid to <hi>avouch his people,</hi> openly to di≈øcover him≈øelf, to a≈ø≈øert it, <hi>that they are his people;</hi> their holine≈øs was a di≈øcrimination, a ≈øeparation from the re≈øt of the people. And in <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6. and 14.2. you have there the very ≈øame things de≈øcribed and di≈øcovered unto you. And now for this, I ≈øhall de≈øire you to take notice of comparing two places of Scripture, which di≈øcovers the holine≈øs of places; in <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.2, 3. <hi>Thou ≈øhalt ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate three cities for the in thee mid≈øt of thy land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee to po≈ø≈øe≈øs it.</hi> And at the ≈øeventh ver≈øe, <hi>Wherefore I command thee, ≈øaying, Thou ≈øhalt ≈øeparate three cities for thee.</hi> Now you ≈øhall have this again propounded to you in <hi>Jo≈øh.</hi> 20.7. <hi>And they ≈øanctified Kade≈øh in Galilee in Napthali, and Sichem in mount Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (which is Hebron) in the mountain of Judah.</hi> Mark, the Scripture that was called <hi>Separation</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.2.7. is here called <hi>Sanctification;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the word in the Hebrew is, <hi>And you ≈øhall ≈øanctifie,</hi> or <hi>make holy the≈øe places;</hi> that is, holy by the ≈øeparation of them unto that employment that I ≈øhall appoint. Hence a thing is ≈øaid to be unholy in Scripture, when it is common, is not ≈øeparated and ≈øet apart to holy employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ≈øervices; and from every thing that is of a civil concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And hence you read in <hi>Acts</hi> 10.14. in the vi≈øion that <hi>Peter</hi> had, God bids <hi>Peter, Kill and eat. But Peter ≈øaid, Not ≈øo, Lord; for I
<pb facs="tcp:62760:34"/>have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.</hi> That that is unclean and unholy, in a way of legal unholine≈øs, is ≈øaid to be common, not ≈øet apart, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. you ≈øhall there read this notion clearly di≈øcovered to you in the New Te≈øtament: <hi>Of how much ≈øorer puni≈øhment ≈øuppo≈øe ye, ≈øhall he be thought worthy, who hath troden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the bloud of the covenant wherewith he was ≈øanctified, an unholy thing?</hi> An unholy thing is a common thing. So that now what is ≈øanctification in the former part of the ver≈øe, is called commonne≈øs and uncleanne≈øs in the latter part. But not to give you any more in≈øtances of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the general nature of holine≈øs is di≈øcrimination or ≈øeparation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To an≈øwer it more particularly, this ≈øetting apart, or di≈øcriminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ≈øeparation of places for holy u≈øes, mu≈øt have the≈øe two properties.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A place that is holy mu≈øt have ≈øuch a ≈øeparation from other places, as that it mu≈øt be alienated from all u≈øes but holy u≈øes, it mu≈øt not at all be employed to civil u≈øes; for the employing of it unto civil u≈øes, mu≈øt be looked upon as ≈øinful and unlawful. Thus in the Scripture, when times, things, per≈øons are reputed as holy, they are to be exempted from common employment: the Sabbath-day, a holy day, <hi>In it thou mu≈øt not do any manner of work.</hi> The Ve≈ø≈øels and Uten≈øils of the Temple were holy, and therefore were not to be u≈øed to ordinary u≈øes; and this as ≈øome do think, was the great ≈øin of <hi>Bel≈øhazzar,</hi> that he would offer to drink in the ve≈ø≈øels of the Temple. And ≈øo the garments of the Prie≈øts were holy, and not to be u≈øed by ≈øecular per≈øons. And the Tabernacle and the Temple were holy, and not to be u≈øed in civil employment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. More particularly, concerning this holine≈øs, I de≈øire to ≈øhew you what it is, by ≈øhewing you, it mu≈øt be ≈øuch a holine≈øs and ≈øeparation as that the ≈øervice done to God in tho≈øe places mu≈øt be accounted and looked upon as a better ≈øervice, and more acceptable, then if ≈øo be it had been el≈øewhere, more acceptable to God, and advantagious to our ≈øelves Now, as places are ≈øaid to be holy in regard they are onely to be for holy ≈øervices; ≈øo</p>
            <p n="2">2. Holy, in regard that holy ≈øervices are onely to be done there, with acceptation or advantage, at lea≈øt with ≈øo great acceptation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I de≈øire you to take notice, that places in Scripture are ≈øaid to be holy, which did ≈øanctifie the Wor≈øhip which was done in them, and ≈øan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the Wor≈øhippers, and ≈øo the very places are part of Wor≈øhip; and ≈øo not onely places in which God was wor≈øhipped, but by which God was wor≈øhipped. And thus the Sabbath was ≈øanctified, and ≈øo the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Gods Wor≈øhip therein, made Gods ≈øervice more acceptable &amp; ≈øanctified. And ≈øo the Altar, when it was holy, it made the gift the more
<pb facs="tcp:62760:34"/>holy and ≈øanctified, and ≈øo the more acceptable, the Altar ≈øanctified the gift, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.18, 19. And ≈øo the incen≈øe was acceptable to God, as being put into ≈øuch a cen≈øer: And ≈øo the ≈øervice done to God in ≈øuch Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, was more acceptable, becau≈øe done in them which God had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtituted and appointed for <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons to wear. And ≈øo I have opened the fir≈øt thing in explanation, and that is to ≈øhew you where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in holine≈øs con≈øi≈øts, and how it is that places or things may be ≈øaid to be holy; and I think I have ≈øufficiently cleared the notion to you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ≈øhew what the cau≈øe or the foundation of this holine≈øs is; for this my Brethren, I ≈øhall de≈øire you al≈øo to take notice of it more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and then more particularly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. More generally, That the cau≈øe and the foundation of a place, or any other thing's holine≈øs, it is its belonging to God, Gods peculiar rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it, and propriety in it, declared as he ≈øhall plea≈øe, and therefore to be holy, &amp; to be Gods, are the words of the like importance, or equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; its being Gods, and his having a relation to it, is the <hi>foundation</hi> and cau≈øe of its <hi>holine≈øs.</hi> And therefore if you look into <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.2. you ≈øhall there find God commands, that <hi>they ≈øhould ≈øanctifie to him all the fir≈øt-born, it is mine;</hi> there now is that which is the cau≈øe, and rea≈øon, and ground of its being ≈øanctified, or holy, it is God him≈øelf; God hath a propriety in it. And therefore I de≈øire you to look into <hi>Luk</hi> 2.23. it will open this notion to you; there you ≈øhall ≈øee that this command is again repeated, but yet in other words; And therefore he ≈øaith, <hi>As it is written in the Law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb ≈øhall be called holy to the Lord;</hi> that which is ≈øaid in one place to be ≈øanctified or ≈øeparated, is here ≈øaid to be holy, and therefore holy becau≈øe ≈øepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27.30. <hi>All the tythes of the Land is the Lords, it is holy unto the Lord;</hi> it is holy, and therefore holy becau≈øe it is the Lords. So that here is the general an≈øwer. This is the foundation, ground, and cau≈øe of its holine≈øs, Gods peculiar propriety in it, it is the Lords.</p>
            <p n="2">2. More particularly, That the declared propriety that God hath in any place, or his relation to a place, or its belonging unto God, that is the foundation of its holine≈øs. This belonging unto God, or Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in it, is declared two ways.</p>
            <p>Its belonging unto God is declared,</p>

            <p n="1">1. By his pre≈øence. Now the pre≈øence of God, that was the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the holine≈øs of a place, was two-fold.</p>

            <p n="1">
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:35"/>1. The extraordinary pre≈øence of God was by his miraculous <hi>appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and di≈øcovering him≈øelf by ≈øome miraculous token, vi≈øion, ≈øign, or manife≈øtation of his pre≈øence, as now here in this <hi>burning, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuming Bu≈øh;</hi> here was a miraculous token of Gods pre≈øence.

Not as if it were holy at that time when the Apo≈øtle writ that Epi≈øtle, but it were manife≈øt, there was an extraordinary manife≈øtation and ≈øign of Gods pre≈øence, and ≈øo long as this extraordinary manife≈øtation of Gods pre≈øence continued, it was called holy.

            <p n="2">2. As the pre≈øence of God was extraordinary, ≈øo it is ordinary, which is two-fold.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The pre≈øence of his ≈øtanding re≈øidence in a place, by ≈øome vi≈øible or external Symbole; or el≈øe</item>
               <item>2. The Pre≈øence of God, is a ≈øpiritual Pre≈øence, in the Religious ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and performances of his people, in the place of their Meetings, and A≈ø≈øemblies. Now concerning the fir≈øt of the≈øe:</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. The pre≈øence of God by the more vi≈øible and la≈øting tokens of his Pre≈øence, which was chiefly afforded in the time of the Levitical Peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue; So the <hi>Altar, Temple, Ark,</hi> and <hi>Mercy-≈øeat,</hi> were ≈øymboles of Gods <hi>pre≈øence</hi> among that people, by them God ≈øignified his <hi>pre≈øence,</hi> he recorded his Name there by tho≈øe vi≈øible tokens of his Pre≈øence; and therefore the Ark was ≈øaid to be Gods face: and when the Ark was lifted up, it was ≈øaid, <hi>Let God ari≈øe, and let his enemies be ≈øcattered.</hi> Hence they ≈øo much rejoyced when the Ark came into the city of <hi>David,</hi> becau≈øe it was the ≈øign of Gods <hi>pre≈øence,</hi> and mourned when it was taken away cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. And God is ≈øaid <hi>to deliver his glory into captivity,</hi> that is, the token of his glorious pre≈øence: and as long as this continued, God was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as there pre≈øent; and thither the people went to pray, and offer ≈øacrifice. And thus God more fixedly declared his durable relation to a place by the≈øe to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> and while the≈øe continued in a place, he was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon to be there.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:35"/>2. Gods ordinary pre≈øence is con≈øiderable in the Religious ≈øervice of his people, and this I call the rather the more ≈øpiritual Pre≈øence of God; that is that pre≈øence of God in the Ordinances, which we have, we hope this day, and which Chri≈øt did promi≈øe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.20. <hi>Where ever two or three are met together in my Name, there am I pre≈øent in the mid≈øt of them:</hi> not in the mid≈øt of the place, but of them, when they do perform holy and in≈øtitute Wor≈øhip. This ≈øpiritual pre≈øence of God is that, that is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded in the u≈øe of tho≈øe Ordinances of Praying, Hearing, and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øtration of Sacraments, his Pre≈øence is there to accept of the≈øe, and ble≈øs them, and make them operative, and to a≈ø≈øi≈øt in the≈øe, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able both Mini≈øter and people to go through their duty by his own power. Nor can Gods Pre≈øence be ordinarily expected, but in this his own way. Now then,</p>
            <p n="2">2. You mu≈øt know, that as the pre≈øence of God is the foundation of a places ≈øanctity, and as it is ≈øeveral, ≈øo you mu≈øt know, Gods propriety in, and relation to a place is declared by his Precept; the precept of God is Gods propriety in a place, as well as his Pre≈øence; thus it belongs to him by command to make it holy, he may do what he will, and chu≈øe out what places he will to be holy. He to whom all things belong, ≈øurely may have ≈øome places and things more proper to him≈øelf und peculiar; ≈øo the Temple of old, and the Tabernacle, tho≈øe Places of Levitical and Ceremonial Wor≈øhip was ≈øeparated and ≈øet apart by God by Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution. Hence we have many commands.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God commands that ≈øuch a Hou≈øe, and ≈øuch a Tabernacle ≈øhall be built, and this had been unlawful to do had it not been commanded.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He directs the manner, and the mode, and that all things ≈øhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly be done according to the pattern in the Mount. And</p>
            <p n="3">3. God doth command it ≈øhould be in ≈øuch a place, in the thre≈øhing-floor of <hi>Araunah</hi> the <hi>Jebu≈øite,</hi> and that place that him≈øelf had cho≈øen.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He commands that he will be ≈øerved in the≈øe places peculiarly, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than in any other place, he would not have the≈øe places changed for others. Herein this place tipifi'd Chri≈øt, one that is onely able to make our ≈øervices acceptable. Hence it is ≈øaid, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.17. <hi>Three times in the year all thy Males ≈øhall appear before the Lord.</hi> And Acts 27. the <hi>Eunuch</hi> there went unto that place that God had commanded.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He doth command, that he would have the≈øe places reverenced, and no civil employments u≈øed there when the holy ≈øervice was doing, and that after the ≈øervice was done, at that very time the place ≈øhould be only for God.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And la≈øtly, He annexed a promi≈øe unto that place, that he would
<pb facs="tcp:62760:36"/>accept of a duty done there rather than in any other place, even becau≈øe it was done there; hence they prayed in the Temple, rather than in their private hou≈øes, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.27. and when they could not be pre≈øent, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of Gods providence, in the Temple, if they do but look to the City and the temple, God accepted of their duty, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.48. So that God did promi≈øe that that place that he had in≈øtituted for his wor≈øhip and ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that the ≈øervice performed there ≈øhould be more acceptable to him than el≈øe-where. This ≈øhews the rea≈øon and foundation of a places holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, the precept of God, and the promi≈øe and pre≈øence of God. And thus I have opened to you the ≈øecond thing. Now having thus explained and opened the Que≈øtion to you;</p>
            <p n="2">2. I come to re≈øolve the Que≈øtion, according to what I think in my con≈øcience to be the truth of God; and this I ≈øhall do two ways.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. By granting that which mu≈øt not be denyed.</item>

            <p n="1">1. By granting what mu≈øt not be denyed: and here I grant willingly the≈øe four things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That in the time of the Go≈øpel; it is not onely lawful, but it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten very commendable and nece≈ø≈øary, to de≈øign and dedicate places unto God. Now when I ≈øay, it is lawful to de≈øign them and to dedicate them; I pray you bear me witne≈øs, I do not ≈øay it is lawful to con≈øecrate them, or to ≈øanctifie them; but I ≈øay it is lawful to de≈øign and dedicate them. Now for this take notice, That between
<list>
                  <item>1. The de≈øigning and appointing of a place;</item>
                  <item>2. the dedication of a place: and</item>
                  <item>3. the con≈øecrating of a place, there are the≈øe differences.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Concerning the de≈øignation of a place, then is a place de≈øigned, when it is appointed to be made u≈øe of for the mo≈øt convenience for ≈øuch a ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as <hi>Tue≈øday</hi> and <hi>Wedne≈øday</hi> may be appointed for Lecture-days, not con≈øecrated. Now you mu≈øt know, that this de≈øignation of a day may be altered, and ≈øo may a place: if ≈øuch a place be de≈øigned, it is in our power to make u≈øe of it, ≈øo as to leave off the u≈øe of it when we plea≈øe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to dedication, I mean ≈øo lawfully to dedicate a place, which is of our own right to di≈øpo≈øe of; ≈øo to dedicate it, as not again to be able to revoke it, or call it back from ≈øuch a u≈øe and purpo≈øe. It is lawful and commendable for a rich man to dedicate ≈øo much ground, or money, for building a Hou≈øe for a Free-School, or for the poor, and to give it away from our ≈øelves, and from our own right and power: and if ≈øo be that a man hath power or propriety over a place or thing, it is lawful for a man to alienate ≈øuch a thing. And yet this you mu≈øt know by the way, that this Dedication that now is in the time of the Go≈øpel, doth very much differ
<pb facs="tcp:62760:36"/>from that dedication of Free-will-offering unto God in the time of the Law; for they were dedicated to God in the time of the Law immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, that is, to his immediate Wor≈øhip; it was part of Gods Wor≈øhip, it was a part of Religion to do that thing: whereas it is not now dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the immediate Wor≈øhip of God, but it is dedicated immediately to ≈øuch a Prie≈øt, or Mini≈øter, or Place, or company of people, that we have a good will to gratifie; and ≈øo it more remotely redounds to Gods glory not immediately. For God hath not declared in his Word the ≈øame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation in the Go≈øpel of things done in an immediate way, as he had in the time of the Law, of which acceptation now we have no ≈øuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe. And therefore it is ob≈øervable, as one ≈øpeaks concerning that Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor in the Go≈øpel to the Jews, <hi>He hath loved our Nation, and builded us a Synagogue;</hi> it is not ≈øaid, <hi>for God,</hi> but <hi>for us:</hi> This man out of love to us hath be≈øtowed the≈øe things to God; which though a giving our ≈øelves out of our own power, yet it doth differ from the Free-will-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the time of the Law. Ay, but now, Sirs, ye mu≈øt know, that ≈øan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, or con≈øecration, that is a great deal more; when we ≈øanctifie a thing, or con≈øecrate a thing, this thing that is ≈øo con≈øecrated, it is ≈øo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that there mu≈øt nothing at all of unholine≈øs, or of a civil or ≈øecular employment and concernment be done in it. Now we do not dedicate a thing, but there may be ≈øecular things in an ordinary and civil way done in them; and our ≈øervices are not more acceptable for the place, nor the places le≈øs holy becau≈øe of tho≈øe civil employments. There is the fir≈øt conce≈ø≈øion, that in the time of the Go≈øpel there may be a de≈øignment and dedication of places, and it is not only lawful, but commendable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I grant, that in times of the Go≈øpel, ≈øome places are to have Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ≈øervices performed in them, rather than in other places; I mean places of natural conveniency, and fitne≈øs for the meeting of people to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, whereby they may be free from di≈øturbance, from the violence of Enemies, and from tempe≈øtuous weather. As publick meetings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we have the ≈øociety of Gods people, their examples to ≈øtir us up to zeal, and their joynt help in prayer and holy performances, to go along with us, that we may joyn our forces together, and with a great force wre≈øtle with God, and overcome him which is invincible. And therefore, my Brethren, I de≈øire you to bear me witne≈øs this day, that I plead for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ordinances, &amp; for the purity of Gods Ordinances to be admini≈øtred in publick places, rather than other places; ≈øo that I do here profe≈øs, that I do avowedly and openly declare my judgement to be for publick meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in publick places, and the purity of Gods Ordinances, if they may be enjoyed without humane mixture, which may hurt and pollute them.</p>

I grant, that in the time of holy ≈øervice, we are not then to u≈øe ≈øecular employments at that time in tho≈øe places, as eating, drinking, and talking, it being un≈øuitable to the work in hand; and how≈øoever they may be lawful at another time, yet unlawful then, becau≈øe again≈øt the Apo≈øtles command, <hi>Let all things be done in decency, and in order;</hi> and that which is un≈øuitable to the commands of God, the taking his Name in vain. My Brethren, I will go further with you, we are to ab≈øtain from all other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Services, when not in ≈øea≈øon; and therefore when the Mini≈øter is in Preaching, we mu≈øt not run into our places and kneel down, as ≈øome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do, and fall a praying. And I cannot but wonder, that they that do ≈øo much cry up Uniformity and Sanctity of places, that yet they ≈øhould con≈øure their judgment by their practice, that they ≈øhould pray ≈øecretly, when the whole Congregation is a praying vocally; and it may be the Congregation is ≈øinging a P≈øalm, or the Mini≈øter Preaching, and then they go to their Prayers; I pray where is the Uniformity, Decency, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they ≈øo much ≈øtand for?</p>
            <p>La≈øtly, I grant, that after the performances of holy duties, in places wherein we meet for the Wor≈øhip and Service of God, it is our duty to ab≈øtain, not only from filthy and indecent actions of a natural or moral filthine≈øs, un≈øeemly, as looked upon by men again≈øt Gods Laws; but from all tho≈øe civil, moral, lawful actions, at other times, they may reflect any di≈øhonour upon the work that hath been done, or upon the work that ≈øhall be done, or that may render the place unmeet for Religious Services afterwards: And this is that that one calls a Negative, or private reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, a reverence or not doing ≈øomething, not becau≈øe the place is more holy, but for decency and order, con≈øidering the Religious Duties per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in that place. So that things ≈øub≈øervient to Religion, call for a Negative reverence, and are not ≈øo to be u≈øed, as that the Religious Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices which are there performed and tran≈øacted, ≈øhould be made di≈øgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and di≈øhonourable; as the Bread of the Sacrament, after the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is done, is not lawful to be ca≈øt unto unrea≈øonable creatures, becau≈øe it reflects di≈øhonour upon the Religious Service which we were before doing; ≈øo, dirty water is not to be put into the Communion-Cup, not that the Cup is holy, but becau≈øe it is a reflection of di≈øgrace upon that holy Service wherein that Cup is made u≈øe of; and that Cup is not to be made u≈øe of to drunkenne≈øs. But in all this bear me witne≈øs that I ≈øay, all this is but a civil reverence, and ≈øo due to any place where there is any Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Convention, as in the Parliament-Hou≈øe, or Pre≈øence Chamber, or the like. Having yielded this:</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:37"/>2. I mu≈øt come now to deny what mu≈øt not be granted: and I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe deny four thing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is not now in the times of the Go≈øpel in any mans power to ≈øet apart a place for Religious duties, ≈øo as that it ≈øhould be unlawful upon a due occa≈øion to u≈øe it for civil employments, or that it ≈øhould be always unlawful to alienate to other u≈øes, be≈øides tho≈øe u≈øes that are Divine; the Bread and Wine ≈øanctified by Gods own in≈øtitution, by the Mini≈øter, after the publick u≈øe and admini≈øtration of them in the Ordinance, are not now holy, but they may be eaten in a civil u≈øe and way as our ordinary and common food. The Synagogues among the Jews were as holy as our Churches, they were for Holy duties, as Prayer, Preaching, and the like, and dedicated to Gods Wor≈øhip, and yet you mu≈øt know there were Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil employments u≈øed in tho≈øe places after the Religious Wor≈øhip was done; and therefore in <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.34. ≈øaith our Saviour, <hi>Some of them you ≈øhall ≈øcourge in your Synagogues.</hi> Hence we u≈øe to keep Courts and Con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtories in Churches among≈øt us, and ≈øome of them none of the be≈øt, and we u≈øe here among us in this City con≈øtantly in our Churches, (and I doubt not but it is lawful) for an Alderman in his Ward to meet about ≈øecular bu≈øine≈øs, as to chu≈øe Common-Council-men, or the like. But where there hath been a dedication of a place to Gods Wor≈øhip, it is onely God that can make it ≈øo holy, as that it ≈øhould be ≈øinful to imploy it to other u≈øes, and if the Governours of the Church upon due occa≈øion and rea≈øon ≈øhall ≈øub≈øtitute other places more fit than the former for Divine Wor≈øhip, then the former places may return to their former proper u≈øes; but it is not ≈øo in things con≈øecrated by God: If the Font, Table, or Pulpit wax old, they may be layed a≈øide and looked upon as common things, and may be u≈øed for other employments; and ≈øuppo≈øe the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice be a lawful Garment in Gods Wor≈øhip, (which yet I am per≈øwaded none of you believe) doubtle≈øs it is not to be burned, when it is old and pa≈øt wearing, and the a≈øhes put into a pot or ≈øome ≈øuch like thing, and be buried under the Altar, but it may be u≈øed as other linnen may. And ≈øo the common Uten≈øils, as the Cup, and the like, when they are come to be old, they may be u≈øed for other employments, without fear of ≈øin. And therefore it is an excellent ≈øpeech of one, ≈øaith he; So to Con≈øecrate moveable or immoveable goods, as that it ≈øhould be a ≈øin for the Church to u≈øe them in any ≈øecular employments, it is an execrable and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ≈øuper≈øtition: God hath not con≈øecrated any thing in the Go≈øpel ≈øo, as that it is a ≈øin to u≈øe it otherwi≈øe. It was a ≈øin in them to make u≈øe of the Cups, in the Temple, in any ≈øecular way, but it is not ≈øo for us: the rea≈øon is, becau≈øe tho≈øe things were ≈øet apart by Gods own in≈øtitution:
<pb facs="tcp:62760:38"/>but there can be nothing ≈øo con≈øecrated by men, as that it may <hi>not be made u≈øe of</hi> in ≈øecular things without ≈øin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ≈øecond thing I deny is, That no place now in the time of the Go≈øpel hath ≈øuch an holine≈øs either from In≈øtitution or U≈øe, as to ≈øancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie or make more acceptable or effectual the Services therein performed: This is not in the time of the Go≈øpel; God is pre≈øent at places of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious performances, not with re≈øpect unto the place, but the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance by him in≈øtituted and enjoyned; and therefore he doth not ≈øay, <hi>Where two or three are met together, I will be in the mid≈øt of that place,</hi> but <hi>among them.</hi> God will be pre≈øent in the place for the Duties ≈øake, not among them for the Places ≈øake, but the Duties ≈øake in the place, to ble≈øs the Ordinance for his own In≈øtitution ≈øake. Prayers and other Duties in the Ceremonial Law were regarded for the Places ≈øake, but now we mu≈øt abhor this piece of Judai≈øm: For a man to ≈øet a place apart by Con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, that this place makes the Duty any thing the more excellent, or acceptable to God, this is to make the Traditions of men equal to the In≈øtitution of God. The Temple ≈øanctified the Duty, but not the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue; and the Altar did ≈øanctifie the Gift, and the Per≈øon and Service, becau≈øe it was by Gods In≈øtitution, and ≈øo the Temple and Altar did add efficacy and worth to the work; but for men to Con≈øecrate the Church, it is to make the appointment of men equal with the In≈øtitution of God. Our Churches and Meeting-places, are not holy (if they be holy at all) without relation to the Duties performed, but our Duties are holy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out relation to the Church or the Place. None but God can Con≈øecrate a place to be an effectual means of Wor≈øhip. The Jews wor≈øhipped God by the Temple, but we wor≈øhip God in the Church, as the place doth afford a natural conveniency for our meeting together; the place then hath no influence at all upon our duties, and if any of you ≈øhould think ≈øo, you do erre exceedingly: It is but only a <hi>Phy≈øical</hi> act of Duty, or a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>Adjunct</hi> of duty, which is but at the mo≈øt helpful to the bodies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third thing I deny is this, That there is no place ≈øo holy as to exclude another place from being as holy in a way of proper ≈øanctity and holine≈øs, which we have been now opening. God now makes not one place properly more holy than another; there is not now properly any Religious difference of places. We have not now the precept of God to ≈øanctifie and ≈øeparate one place from another, to preferre one place before another; we have not now the miraculous Pre≈øence of God, his appearing as at the Bu≈øh. God hath not given us under the Go≈øpel tho≈øe Symboles of his ≈øtanding Pre≈øence and Re≈øidency, as by the <hi>Ark,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:62760:38"/>
               <hi>Mercy-Seat,</hi> and <hi>Altar</hi> of old, he gave unto <hi>his People.</hi> And as for his Ordinances, if they make a place holy in regard of performance of Duty to God there, and his ≈øpiritual pre≈øence in that place, then my Parlour, Chamber, or Clo≈øet are holy where I u≈øe to pray; and where God doth afford his a≈ø≈øi≈øting ble≈ø≈øing, and comforting pre≈øence: So that if you make the ≈øpiritual pre≈øence of God to make a thing holy, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Gods ≈øpiritual pre≈øence going along with tho≈øe ≈øervices, then your Hou≈øes are holy, and the Field is holy where you walk when you me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, and praying by the River ≈øide makes it holy: Humane Con≈øecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes no place truly holy. If the ≈øpiritual pre≈øence of Chri≈øt makes one place more holy than another, then the Communion-Table and Font are more holy than any other place in the Temple. And ≈øo when Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence hath been enjoyed at the Font, that is more holy than the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion-Table; and ≈øo when the pre≈øence of God hath been enjoyed at the Communion-Table, that is more holy than the Font, and ≈øo you mu≈øt bring in Judai≈øm. If the pre≈øence of God makes a thing holy, a new Communion-Table, upon which the Sacraments was never admini≈øtred, cannot be ≈øo holy as the old Table. Nay, by this the mouths of the Communicants are holy, having eaten the Bread, and drank the Wine which was dedicated to an holy u≈øe, and ≈øo it will be ≈øinful for you to eat any other food. I conclude all with this, That the difference and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of Religious places in the times of the Go≈øpel, is not given, but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by the Go≈øpel, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. <hi>I will therefore that men pray eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting.</hi> You may pray, and that with as much acceptablene≈øs to God in one place as in another, <hi>John</hi> 4.21. Chri≈øt ≈øaith, <hi>The time comes when you ≈øhall neither in this Mountain, nor yet at Jeru≈øalem, wor≈øhip the Father:</hi> That is, Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip and Service ≈øhall not be confined and limited to tho≈øe places, as if others were not as good and holy as they. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. <hi>To them that are ≈øanctified in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, called to be Saints, with all that in every place call upon the Name of Je≈øus Chri≈øt our Lord, both theirs and ours. One</hi> place for the calling upon Chri≈øt is as good as <hi>another;</hi> and therefore, <hi>Where two or three are gathered together, I will be in the mid≈øt of them.</hi> And this is fore-told in <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.11. and in <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.11. So that this is the ≈øum of all, Gods In≈øtitution makes the Sabbath holy; and the Bread and the Wine ≈øet apart by Gods own In≈øtitution, after the duty, may be u≈øed in ≈øecular u≈øes</p>
            <p>But fourthly and la≈øtly, to name no more, No place is ≈øo ≈øanctified by God, as that after the cea≈øing of that pre≈øence of God, any holine≈øs ≈øhould belong unto it; as now when the ≈øigns and tokens of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence
<pb facs="tcp:62760:39"/>cea≈øed and was gone, the holine≈øs of that place was gone, and then it was lawful for <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> to <hi>put on his ≈øhooes.</hi> And ≈øo when Gods pre≈øence cea≈øed in the Ark, the Altar, and Mercy-≈øeat, the places became no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ≈øecular, and civil. And now for us to go about (as the Papi≈øts do) a Pilgrimage to <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> as if that place had any more holine≈øs than others, is a fooli≈øh and abominable thing: How many bloody Battels have been fought, to the di≈øgrace, as well as the lo≈øs of Chri≈øtianity, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining of the Holy Land.</p>
            <p>Nay, let me add, tho≈øe places where the pre≈øence of God hath been formerly, when it hath taken away, and tho≈øe places have been u≈øed to Idolatry, they are the wor≈øe, and the more unholy; for this is turning the Hou≈øe of God into vanity.</p>
            <p>The conclu≈øion of all is this: whatever places are in holy duties, out of them they lo≈øe and leave all their holine≈øs; and therefore I ≈øay it is boldne≈øs for us to go about to tie Gods pre≈øence to a place where God hath never tied it: I cannot but wonder how it is po≈ø≈øible for men of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon and learning to be ≈øo blind, as to hold that the Lords day (which was ≈øet apart by God for the Sabbath, as you may ≈øee in the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and afterwards by Chri≈øt and his Apo≈øtles, which doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to no le≈øs than an In≈øtitution) is not holy after the Service or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is ended, but then you may go play at Foot-ball, and Cudgels, and Drinking, and what not; and yet they ≈øhould ≈øay that the place of performing Religious duties in, is ≈øo holy after Religious performances, as that you cannot come into it without bowing the knee, and putting off the hat, and bowing to the Altar and Communion-Table, and the like; this I cannot apprehend how it ≈øhould be, and I wi≈øh any of you that are of this mind, would privately give me your rea≈øons for it, why it ≈øhould be ≈øo.</p>
            <p>Now having explained the Point, and given you a re≈øolution of the que≈øtion, in the≈øe particulars, give me leave to winde up all with ≈øome U≈øes.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, We infer the great difference that is between ≈øanctity of places under the Old Te≈øtament, and ≈øanctity and holine≈øs of places under the New Te≈øtament: they under the Old Te≈øtament had the immediate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of God, the ≈øtanding Symbols, and vi≈øible ≈øigns of his pre≈øence, ≈øo long as the≈øe la≈øted: which was ≈øet apart by Gods ≈øpecial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and ≈øo they were holy, though they were not employed in a way of wor≈øhip; but you cannot ≈øay ≈øo now, our places for performance of holy duties have no ≈øuch holine≈øs; places now differ from places then.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:39"/>Secondly, by way of inference, I note the great goodne≈øs of God to give us ≈øuch a ≈øweet and gracious indulgent di≈øpen≈øation in the time of the Go≈øpel under the New Te≈øtament, as that he doth not tye us to Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies or places; he doth not bind us as he did the <hi>Jews</hi> to go three times in the year to the furthermo≈øt part of the Nation to wor≈øhip: No my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, no Land, no ground is now unholy, as famous old Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> ≈øaid, every place is now a <hi>Judea,</hi> no Coa≈øt but is a <hi>Judea,</hi> every hou≈øe is a <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> every Congregation is now a <hi>Sion:</hi> See here the goodne≈øs of God in indulging of us ≈øo far as to take any ≈øervice done by us in a ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and real manner, as if it had been done in tho≈øe places which were formerly appointed for it to be done in.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I infer hence, there are ≈øeveral per≈øons to be reproved.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. We find hereby that all the holine≈øs of Relicks of Saints doth fall to the ground, and we ≈øee the folly of tho≈øe that make Pilgrimages unto Saints and Reliques as the <hi>Papi≈øts</hi> do: there was a time (≈øay they) when ≈øuch a Saints Relicks were laid up in ≈øuch a place, and the≈øe are more holy then other places: ≈øo that this you ≈øee falls to the ground in its ≈øelf: I might tell you concerning their lying about their Relicks, as one ≈øaid, that there were as many Reliques as would fill an hundred Carts: but ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øing ≈øo, all that would not make that place the more holy.</item>
               <item>2. Hence the ≈øuper≈øtition of tho≈øe is to be reproved, which put holine≈øs in place of Burial, and make it more holy to be buried in one place then in another: it is more holy (≈øay they) to be buried in the Church then in the Church-yard; and more holy under the Communion-Table then in any other part of the Church.</item>
               <item>3. This reproves them which cannot pray any where but in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and they that u≈øe private prayers in Churches: if you have hou≈øes and Rooms at home, what is the rea≈øon that if <hi>Pauls</hi> or any other Church ≈øtand open you mu≈øt run in thither, and drop down behind a Pillar to ≈øay your Prayers.</item>
               <item>4. This reproves them that have reverence towards any place more then another, as if they did de≈øerve more holine≈øs in one part then another, as bowing to the Altar, or Communion-Table, or the like.</item>
               <item>5. It reproves tho≈øe that have reverence for ≈øcituation of the≈øe places, they mu≈øt ≈øtand Ea≈øt and We≈øt, and why not North and South? All the≈øe things fall off, like Fig-leaves: if what I have ≈øaid be true, that there is no holine≈øs in places; and this I have made known to you not only as my judgment, but as my duty.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Now for exhortation, I ≈øhall de≈øire you to take notice of four things, and I have done, and ≈øhall leave you to God, and commit you to the
<pb facs="tcp:62760:40"/>word of his grace. If this be ≈øo, that there is no holine≈øs in places, then fir≈øt of all, bee the more encouraged to ≈øerve God in your Families, in tho≈øe places where God hath ≈øet you, where God is as well plea≈øed with your ≈øervice as in publick places, ≈øerve God upon your knees with devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, humility and reverence. And therefore, though I am again≈øt Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per≈øtition, and Popi≈øh practices, and tho≈øe wicked cur≈øed traps of innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that the men of the World have di≈øturbed the Church of God with; yet I am again≈øt putting on your Hats in prayer; and ≈øitting in Prayer. Tho≈øe that are for holine≈øs of places, do not, with <hi>Abraham,</hi> in every place they come build God an Altar. But let us in every clo≈øet and room build God an Altar; let no morning nor evening go without a Prayer in thy Family, pray often, and pray continually, let your hou≈øes be as ≈øo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Churches, as you read in <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.5. <hi>Likewi≈øe greet the Church that is in their Hou≈øe:</hi> and in the ≈øecond ver≈øe of <hi>Philemons</hi> Epi≈øtle, <hi>To the Church that is in thy Hov≈øe;</hi> There the Hou≈øes of the Saints are called Churches. This will bring a ble≈ø≈øing upon your Families: And if you be not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have that cur≈øe denounced again≈øt you, (in <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.25. <hi>Pour out fury upon the Heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not upon thy Name</hi>) then neglect not Family-Prayers, be much in Prayer, and pray with frequency and encouragement, becau≈øe God binds you to no place.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond Exhortation is this, labour to promote <hi>per≈øonal holine≈øs,</hi> as well as <hi>Family Devotion:</hi> I am again≈øt local holine≈øs: As one ≈øaid, (that I heared once when I was a Youth) Happy are tho≈øe garments that can carry away any of the du≈øt of the Temple; but they think not that any of their Garments are unclean in wallowing in the mire of ≈øin. But I ≈øay, do you labour to promote holine≈øs in your lives, in your hearts and conver≈øations. The <hi>Holy Gho≈øt</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nle≈øs you be pure in heart you ≈øhall not ≈øee God.</hi> And therefore put away ≈øin, for if you regard iniquity; God will not hear your prayers: It is not your ducking, or bowing, or cringing never ≈øo much, or your going with your Hat off through the Church that will make God hear your Prayers, the≈øe will but di≈øhonour you, becau≈øe you live not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Love the holine≈øs of the living Members, be not ≈øo much in love with the Holine≈øs of Wood and Timber, Bricks and Stones; but where≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you ≈øee the Image of Chri≈øt, be in love with that ≈øoul; where ever the Pre≈øence of God ≈øhines, and where ever thou ≈øee≈øt one that gives up him≈øelf to God in holy duties, do thou ≈øay, Oh! my ≈øoul, delight to come into the company of the≈øe men, <hi>The Righteous is more excellent then his neighbour.</hi> If there be a Heaven upon earth, I tell you, it is in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb facs="tcp:62760:40"/>of godly men. I remember a famous man hath this expre≈ø≈øion, ≈øaith he, When I was in the company of the Saints and people of God, I was as a living coal; but when I was ≈øeparated from them, and was among the wicked Swearers and Drunkards, methoughts there was a ≈øpiritual coldne≈øs and frozenne≈øs went over my ≈øoul. Though the People of God are be≈øt company in Heaven, yet they are very good company here on earth: And Chri≈øtians ≈øhould ≈øtir up one another, and be provoking one another to love and good works; and where ever you have grace, be ≈øure to impart it to others. Endeavour to love the holine≈øs of Saints, and be willing to impart your experiences to others, for this is your duty. Do not make a Monopoly of Holine≈øs, but carry company with you to Heaven.</p>
            <p>La≈øtly, to name no more, labour to pre≈øerve the holine≈øs of Gods true In≈øtitutions, tho≈øe things which are of divine Con≈øecration. What is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Con≈øecration without divine In≈øtitution? The Sabbath day is of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine In≈øtitution, labour to keep it holy; this is a Holy day indeed, and this labour to keep your families from profaning of; but for other holy dayes, and holy things, they are much alike for holine≈øs: The Lords day is a holy day indeed, and for ≈øhame, do not let your children gad abroad on this day. Truly, I do verily believe, that though here be a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of people in the Congregation, yet they are but a handful in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pari≈øon of what are drinking in Ale-hou≈øes, and whoring, and walking in the Fields, that one can hardly get home to their hou≈øe for the crowd of the people that are going thither. For ≈øhame let not this be told in <hi>Gath,</hi> nor publi≈øhed in <hi>Askelon.</hi> What! ≈øhall we ≈øtand up for the holine≈øs of places, and yet oppo≈øe the holine≈øs of the Lords day, which God hath enjoyned and in≈øtituted? Oh! that the Magi≈øtrates of <hi>London;</hi> Oh! that <hi>Englands</hi> King; Oh! that <hi>Englands</hi> Parliament would do ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the Reformation of this, to oppo≈øe wickedne≈øs and prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, which will otherwi≈øe bring upon us the judgments of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and make us guilty and worthy of a thou≈øand puni≈øhments. And labour by Prayer in your Families to overcome that flood of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanene≈øs, which you cannot by your ≈øtrength prevent. And then for the Sacraments of Chri≈øt, <hi>Bapti≈øm</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> the≈øe are Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Gods appointment, they are holy, and therefore ≈øhould not be given to tho≈øe that are unholy; and yet tho≈øe who are ≈øo much for the holine≈øs of places, do not care who come to the Sacrament, if they have but a No≈øe on their Face, they ≈øhall come and partake of the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, let them be what they will; this is to prefer mans In≈øtitution before Gods In≈øtitution.

            <p>OMitting the divi≈øion, and in part the opening of the words, the Ob≈øervations is; <hi>That tho≈øe that have received Chri≈øt Je≈øus the Lord, mu≈øt accordingly bee rooted, built up in him, and e≈øtabli≈øhed in the Faith; and walk in him as they have been taught, and abound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with thanksgiving.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This receiving of Chri≈øt ≈øignifies to believe in him. It is not only to receive his Doctrine or Benefits, but to receive his per≈øon, to receive him as related to us, for the u≈øes and end for which he came into the World, and for which he offers him≈øelf to ≈øouls, by the Preaching of the Go≈øpel. Sinners have lo≈øt and undone them≈øelves; Chri≈øt comes to be the Phy≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian of Souls; hee will not ≈øave the <hi>unwilling,</hi> and <hi>De≈øpi≈øers of his Grace,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:41"/>while they continue in their unwillingne≈øs. He will ≈øave them by the way of covenant, while he con≈øents and tenders them his Grace, he will have them <hi>con≈øent to the terms of his Covenant.</hi> The con≈øent of the heart expre≈øt by our covenanting with him, is this receiving of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. He is willing to be our Phy≈øitian, and when we take him to be ≈øo, we receive him. He is willing to ≈øave us from the guilt and power of ≈øin, willing to be our Lord, Head, Interce≈ø≈øor with God, Ju≈øtifier, and all unto us; and if we con≈øent to this, and take him as offered, this is receiving Chri≈øt; with whom his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits are al≈øo received, the remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øins, in-dwelling, renewing, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ≈øpirit, title to everla≈øting life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In receiving Chri≈øt all this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p>Receiving of Chri≈øt contains the≈øe two things, or the≈øe two things are e≈ø≈øentially contained to make up the nature of ≈øaving Faith, that is, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Doctrine of the Go≈øpel concerning Je≈øus Chri≈øt to bee true, and to con≈øent that the goodne≈øs that is therein revealed and propo≈øed, ≈øhall be ours. To believe what Chri≈øt is, and what he hath done; ≈øo far to believe it, as here we are re≈øolved to venture our ≈øouls, (though there may be ≈øome weakne≈øs through our Faiths imperfection) and believing the Go≈øpel to be the certain Word of God: Then next, to entertain the Chri≈øt that is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in this Go≈øpel to be ours, with all the benefits that accompany, and to all the ble≈ø≈øed ends to which he is revealed: Thus the Water of Life is freely tendered to all that are athir≈øt, and there is no more required, but come and drink.</p>
            <p>Then there is two things implyed, that are the immediate products of ≈øaving Faith, and in≈øeparable from it, that is, tru≈øting on him as the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and obeying him as a Lord. To re≈øt upon him as a Redeemer, <hi>Romans</hi> 15.12. And here as far as the ≈øoul feels entertainment and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement by Chri≈øt, overcoming his doubts that Chri≈øt will reject him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ≈øo far he hath quietne≈øs of ≈øoul in Chri≈øt, and will tru≈øt his ≈øoul upon Chri≈øt. And then, the obeying of him in order to our full recovery, as a Patient mu≈øt obey his Phy≈øitian in u≈øing his Remedies, and Means he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribes for killing our ≈øins, re≈øtoring our ≈øouls to Gods love, and being with him to eternity.</p>
            <p>The nature of Faith is to receive Chri≈øt; the ≈øincerity of it lies in the ≈øuitablene≈øs of the act to the object; that we receive him as he is: Now, in Chri≈øt there is ≈øomething e≈ø≈øential to this act; that he be a Saviour, and our Saviour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and there is ≈øomething makes unto the well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and fuller attaining of the end: The fir≈øt are <hi>the objects of Faith it ≈øelf,</hi> as 'tis of ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øity to Salvation: The ≈øecond ≈øort are <hi>the objects of Faith as it is ≈øtrong,</hi> and makes to the well being of a Chri≈øtian.
<pb facs="tcp:62760:42"/>All that is e≈ø≈øential to Chri≈øt, as a Saviour, and Redeemer, is to be believed by him that will approve him≈øelf a true Believer. And thus to receive Chri≈øt <hi>as the eternal Son of God, made man, the Redeemer of the World,</hi> ruling us upon the right of Redemption, ju≈øtifying us before God, bringing us to God, and interceding for us: And thus Chri≈øt mu≈øt be received according to his Offices, and as tho≈øe u≈øes for which he is given to the ≈øoul do import and imply.</p>
            <p>For the Application of this Point;</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Let us begin with tho≈øe that our bu≈øine≈øs at pre≈øent doth not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lye on. Mu≈øt men <hi>walk in Chri≈øt as they have received him?</hi> What ≈øhall we ≈øay to tho≈øe that <hi>have not, will not receive him?</hi> ≈øtop us at the door, that we cannot bring in the doctrine of Chri≈øt; that <hi>will not receive the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chri≈øt?</hi> How can we bring them, and build them up, that will not ≈øuffer the Foundation to be laid, the Seed to be received? Ha≈øt thou not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Chri≈øt? then thou ha≈øt refu≈øed Chri≈øt, been a de≈øpi≈øer of the Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chri≈øt, which will prove thy great condemnation. What is it for thee to hear the Name, and not to have the Spirit of Chri≈øt? Do not go up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conjectures; its one thing to number thy ≈øelf with tho≈øe that are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians, as to outward appearanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>, and another thing to open thy heart, and deliver up thy ≈øelf to Chri≈øts Government, and as a lo≈øt Sinner, to receive him to tho≈øe ends a Saviour mu≈øt be received. And remember, this was no ≈ømall worke, Gods ≈øending Chri≈øt into the world no ≈ømall thing to fetch thee, from Hell and Satan, to wa≈øh guilty ≈øouls from all their ≈øins, and to bring them to everla≈øting glory. If the≈øe great things be rightly under≈øtood and believed by thee, if Chri≈øt be under≈øtood well as Chri≈øt, it mu≈øt be done with a weakened, humbled, ≈øelf-re≈øigned heart, making the greate≈øt matter in the world of the≈øe things: Hath thy ≈øoul been ≈øeriou≈øly taken up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thy own recovery? And ha≈øt thou received Chri≈øt as a man that was ready to be damned; as one that had a load on his Soul heavier than all the Mountains of the Earth, to ea≈øe and deliver him? as one that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the frowns of God in a ≈øtate of enmity, receives reconciliation? Ha≈øt thou received Chri≈øt, as if thou had≈øt received Heaven in him? Believe it, the≈øe are great tran≈øactions, and will affect thy heart; and it is not a ≈øleepy or je≈øting matter thus to receive Chri≈øt. Con≈øider what it is to receive Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If you have received Chri≈øt, you have received the great <hi>Reconciler</hi> that bindes up the broken hearted, quiets tho≈øe that tremble under the threatnings of God, for fear he ≈øhould for≈øake and ca≈øt them off for ever.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If thou ha≈øt received Chri≈øt, thou ha≈øt received a perfect enmity to
<pb facs="tcp:62760:42"/>all ≈øin, that will never let thee re≈øt in ≈øin, but be per≈øwading thee from it, and conflicting in thee again≈øt ≈øin in thy ≈øoul: If thou ha≈øt received Chri≈øt, thou ha≈øt not received a friend for ≈øin, that will plead for, or give thee leave to commit ≈øin; but one, that though he bear with thee in thy weakne≈øs, yet abominates thy ≈øin. If thou ha≈øt received a Lord and Ma≈øter to rule, to be con≈øented and ≈øubjected to him, and to be ruled by none but in ≈øubordination to him, who will break tho≈øe in pieces that refu≈øe his Government: <hi>Obedience,</hi> and not <hi>verbal profe≈ø≈øion,</hi> is the thing he requires. Ha≈øt thou entertained Chri≈øt to be the Ma≈øter of thy words, thoughts, and deeds, who≈øe Government thou live≈øt under, more than under any in the world?</p>
            <p n="3">3. If you have received Chri≈øt, you have then received the beginning of felicity, and full contentment to your ≈øouls; having found none in your ≈øins, you have it di≈øcovered to you where it is: therefore with gladne≈øs go you on; and ≈øo far as you have hopes of attaining it, ≈øo far you have great contentment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>I come now to exhort all poor weak Chri≈øtians, that they would make after confirmation, and grow to a greater mea≈øure in Grace, as they have received Chri≈øt. It is not enough to be conceited that you have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; and it will not be enough to the a≈ø≈øurance of your conver≈øation, or ≈øafety of your ≈øouls, that you think you are converted, and you ≈øit down there: He that is content with the opinion he hath Grace; therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øires to have no more, becau≈øe the promi≈øe of ≈øalvation is made to the <hi>Truth of Grace,</hi> it is a ≈øign he never had Grace; <hi>Strength in Grace</hi> is your own felicity, 'tis part of your happine≈øs: Your eternal happine≈øs will partly con≈øi≈øt in your per≈øonal perfection; and without per≈øonal perfection, all Heavenly glory will not be a perfect felicity.

               <item>2. Your receiving Chri≈øt e≈ø≈øentially, contains in it an obligation to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed and go further; actually to tru≈øt and obey him, whom you have taken for your Lord and Saviour, from the very Offices and Relations of Chri≈øt received.</item>

How many times hath the Preacher been gladded to ≈øee ≈øuch a one come to him, ≈øeemingly with a broken heart, ≈øeeming to ≈øet them≈øelves in the way of life! yet the fle≈øh prevailed for want of confirmation.

Set your ≈øelves to the reading of the Scripture and other good Books; ≈øtudy good truths: think not to attain ma≈øtery in a day: And if ever ≈øuch a conceit come in your minds, that you are ≈øtrong confirmed Chri≈øtians, do not ea≈øily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain it, there mu≈øt be time, indu≈øtry, and diligence: ordinarily ≈øu≈øpect the conceit you may have of ≈øtrength and confirmation; you mu≈øt grow by degrees: Gods method is to begin like a <hi>grain of mu≈øtard-≈øeed:</hi> we are not born men: labour in the proper means with patience, infu≈øed gifts are given according to the manner of acquitting them: God gives as if our acqui≈øition did attain it; never think of having this without pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, labour, and diligence.</item>

            <p>THe≈øe are the words of our ble≈ø≈øed Lord and Saviour Je≈øus Chri≈øt, they are ≈øpoken by him≈øelf: and they are ≈øpoken of him≈øelf; though yet in a ≈øober and mode≈øt ≈øence they are applicable to all his Members: that which Chri≈øt here affirms, is that the pre≈øence of God was always with him, and this is fir≈øt propounded, <hi>He that ≈øent me is with me,</hi> and then it is amplified, <hi>and the Father hath not
<pb facs="tcp:62760:53"/>left me alone;</hi> and then thirdly, the rea≈øon of this is annexed, <hi>for I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways do tho≈øe things that plea≈øe him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ≈øhall ≈øpeak but very little of the words as they do refer to Chri≈øt: he tells us where his Father was with him, he did not leave him alone in all the troubles and difficulties that he met withal in the fini≈øhing the great work of mans Redemption; ≈øtill God was with him: It is true, there was a time when Chri≈øt was without the ≈øen≈øible manife≈øtation of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers pre≈øence, when he cryed out, <hi>My God, my God, why ha≈øt thou for≈øaken me?</hi> Why, but yet even then in truth and in reality his Father did not leave him; for though he had not the evidences of his Fathers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence, yet he had the influences of his Fathers pre≈øence. It would take up much time to ≈øhew you how in all particulars the Father was pre≈øent with Chri≈øt; I will onely ≈øpeak this one word, and in≈øtance in this one thing, Gods a≈ø≈øi≈øting pre≈øence was always with him, both in his active, and al≈øo in his pa≈ø≈øive obedience; and indeed he had that work to do, and tho≈øe mi≈øeries to ≈øuffer, that if God had left him, if he had not been mightily a≈ø≈øi≈øted by the Divine Nature, Chri≈øt as meer man, could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have done, nor have ≈øuffered what he did; but the Father was with him, and to ≈øupport him, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 42.1. <hi>Behold my ≈øervant whom I uphold.</hi> You ≈øhall find that Chri≈øt did act faith upon this, in <hi>I≈øai.</hi> 50.7. <hi>The Lord God will help me, therefore ≈øhall I not be confounded,</hi> ver≈ø 9. <hi>The Lord will help me.</hi> So to the ≈øame effect is <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 16.9. And you ≈øhall find this made good to him in Scripture, in his greate≈øt nece≈ø≈øities.</p>
            <p>Take a double in≈øtance.</p>
            <p>In the fir≈øt place, after he bad been engaged in the combat with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, you read in <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. the ≈øtronge≈øt combate or duel that ever was fought; wherein you have the Prince of Peace and the Prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs; the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and the roaring Lion that ≈øeeks how to devour; both of them putting forth their utmo≈øt ≈øtrength, and endeavouring to overcome each other: Now I ≈øay in this combate, the Father did not leave Chri≈øt, but he helps him; for he ≈øends an Angel to mini≈øter unto him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.11.</p>
            <p>So in Chri≈øts bitter Agony in the Garden, ju≈øt before his bitter Pa≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and death upon the Cro≈øs, the Father did not leave him alone, for he ≈øent an Angel unto him to ≈øtrengthen him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.43. and ≈øo in ≈øeveral other places, and in ≈øeveral other things I might in≈øtance; but I ≈øhall pa≈øs this by. I but now why did the Father thus ≈øtand by Chri≈øt? he gives you the rea≈øon of it in the Text, becau≈øe he always did the things that plea≈øed him: This I ≈øhall open in a double re≈øpect.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Chri≈øts undertaking of the work of our Redemption; it was
<pb facs="tcp:62760:53"/>very well plea≈øing unto his Father, that poor lo≈øt undone ≈øinners ≈øhould be brought back again unto God, and re≈øtored unto his love and favour: I ≈øay the Father was infinitely well plea≈øed with Chri≈øt in this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 35.10. <hi>The plea≈øure of the Lord ≈øhall pro≈øper in his hand;</hi> the plea≈øure of the Lord, that is the work of our Redemption; wherein God the Father took great plea≈øure or delight; therefore when Chri≈øt was publickly in the eye of the world to enter upon this great work, the Father ≈øends him out with this witne≈øs. <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea≈øed.</hi> He ≈øpeaks not of this well-plea≈øing only to his per≈øon, but al≈øo of his well-plea≈øing as unto his undertaking.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as the work it ≈øelf was well plea≈øing unto God, ≈øo Chri≈øt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of this work, was all along plea≈øing unto his Father; &amp; that doth appear in this, that Chri≈øt in all things kept to his Fathers Commi≈ø≈øion, and to his Fathers Command: I ≈øay in all things he kept to his Fathers Commi≈ø≈øion: he did nothing here upon earth, but what was within the compa≈øs of his Commi≈ø≈øion; for ≈øaith he in the ver≈øe before the Text, <hi>I do nothing of my ≈øelf, but as my Father bids me:</hi> So al≈øo he acted in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to his Fathers will; that was the rule and ≈øquare by which Chri≈øt ordered all his actions; his eye was ≈øtill upon his Fathers will; whatever he willed him to do, that he did; whatever he willed him to ≈øuffer, that he ≈øuffered; and thus he always did the things that were plea≈øing to his Father: but I do not intend further upon the words in this reference; for my de≈øign is to bring down the words unto our ≈øelves, to tho≈øe that are the Members of Chri≈øt; for there is the ≈øame di≈øpo≈øition of heart in all Believers to plea≈øe God: In all things to plea≈øe God; this was the frame and temper and carriage of Chri≈øt; ≈øo it is the frame &amp; temper of every true believer: and this is a part of our likene≈øs unto Chri≈øt; as you know there is a ble≈ø≈øed re≈øemblance &amp; ≈øimilitude between Chri≈øt and his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; they have the ≈øame Spirit that Chri≈øt had, only in a different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; for he had it without mea≈øure; they have the ≈øame Grace as Chri≈øt had for ≈øub≈øtance, though not for degree; <hi>Of his fulne≈øs we all have received grace for grace;</hi> that is, as many interpret it, <hi>Grace an≈øwerable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to grace:</hi> As the print in the wax an≈øwers to the print in the Seal, &amp; as face an≈øwers to face; ≈øo grace in believers an≈øwers unto that grace that was in Chri≈øt; they are to ≈øhew forth the vertues of Chri≈øt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Now this was the grace and vertue and holine≈øs of Chri≈øt, that he always did the things that plea≈øed his Father.</hi> Why this is in all believers, only with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; it was actual performance in the one, it is but endeavour in the other; it was perfect in the one, it is ≈øincere, but imperfect in the other.</p>
            <p>Chri≈øt always did things that plea≈øed God, a Believer endeavours al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb facs="tcp:62760:54"/>to do the things that plea≈øe God, he doth not always do ≈øo; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs <hi>David</hi> in the ca≈øe of his uncleanne≈øs, when he di≈øplea≈øed the Lord, as it is in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>The Ob≈øervation I intend to ≈øpeak to, ≈øhall be this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They that plea≈øe God, and endeavour always to do the things that plea≈øe God, ≈øuch God will be with; ≈øuch the Father will not leave alone; e≈øpecially in times of ≈øuffering and trouble, for I will bring it that at ca≈øe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed God will not leave ≈øuch at any time; for that promi≈øe is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding full, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>I will never leave thee, nor for≈øake thee.</hi> I do not know any one promi≈øe in all the Bible, that is expre≈øt with ≈øuch an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha≈øis as that promi≈øe is; ≈øuch a multiplication of Negatives in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. But e≈øpecially God will not leave ≈øuch in an afflicted and ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering condition.</p>
            <p>In the pro≈øecution of this, I will ≈øpeak to four things:</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, I will ≈øhew you when a man may be ≈øaid to do the things that plea≈øe God.
<list>
                  <item>2. I will confirm the truth of the doctrine.</item>
                  <item>3. I will ≈øhew you in what re≈øpects God will be with them that de≈øire to plea≈øe him in a ≈øuffering condition.</item>
                  <item>4. I will give you the grounds and rea≈øons of it; and then I ≈øhall come to an Application.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For the fir≈øt, We plea≈øe God in what we do, when we act. 1. In a ≈øuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablene≈øs to Gods nature. And 2. In ≈øubjection to Gods Law: For plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing of God lies in the≈øe two things. As that plea≈øes a man which is ≈øuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his di≈øpo≈øition, and is corre≈øpondent with his command: We do the things that plea≈øe God, when we do the things that God doth; and when we do that which God commands: when we hate ≈øin, as God hates ≈øin; when we are holy as God is holy. You ≈øhall find it in <hi>Col.</hi> 1.10. <hi>That you may walk worthy of God, unto all well plea≈øing.</hi> Ob≈øerve, This walking worthy of God, is walking ≈øuitably, or walking an≈øwerably to God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Bring forth fruit worthy of Repentance,</hi> or bring forth fruit an≈øwerable to Repentance; So to walk worthy of God, is to walk ≈øuitable to God, to his nature: Now then ob≈øerve what follows, that you might walk worthy of God to all well-plea≈øing, then we plea≈øe God when we walk ≈øuitably unto God: So al≈øo when we act in a ble≈ø≈øed confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to God, to his law; for nothing can plea≈øe the good God, but what is good: Now the Law being the mea≈øure, and ≈øtandard of all goodne≈øs, nothing can be good, but what bears conformity to this Law, which is the will of God. God is wel-plea≈øed, when his will is ob≈øerved: As you know, you that are Ma≈øters, your ≈øervants plea≈øe you when they do your will. That inference of the Apo≈øtle, for this is very oppo≈øite, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.8. <hi>So then they that are in the fle≈øh cannot plea≈øe God.</hi> What is this ≈øame inference
<pb facs="tcp:62760:54"/>grounded upon, becau≈øe the carnal mind is enmity again≈øt God: for it is not ≈øubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be; ≈øo that they that are in the fle≈øh, cannot plea≈øe God. Why? becau≈øe there is that princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in them, as carries out a real enmity to the Law and Will of God; it is as if the Apo≈øtle had ≈øaid, They will not be ≈øubject to Gods will, not obedient to Gods command; there is a principle of enmity in them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the≈øe things, &amp; ≈øo cannot plea≈øe God: God is plea≈øed when his will is fulfilled, &amp; his commands ob≈øerved; to plea≈øe God, is in all things ≈øo to act, that whatever we do, we may expre≈øs a likene≈øs to Gods na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> and a ble≈ø≈øed ≈øubjection to Gods revealed will, and this is the fir≈øt thing.</p>
            <p>A ≈øecond thing is the proof of the Doctrine; they that thus plea≈øe God, he will be with them, he will not leave them alone; e≈øpecially in an hour of tryal: For, my Brethren, a≈ø≈øure your ≈øelves of this, that which the Father did for Chri≈øt, he will do for all his Members, 'tis true, Chri≈øts ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings being greater then ours po≈ø≈øibly can be, and ≈øo his relation to God being higher then ours is; he a Son by eternal Generation, we one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by adoption; he had the pre≈øence of God in a more glorious manner then we can expect; but yet in our Sphere according to the mea≈øure of our tryals, and according to our capacity, we ≈øhall as really have the pre≈øence of God with us, as Chri≈øt had with him; that as we are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Chri≈øts ≈øufferings, ≈øo we al≈øo ≈øhall be partakers of Chri≈øts ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; he that will be pre≈øent with believers in heaven, as he is with Chri≈øt, he will be pre≈øent with believers here on earth, as he is with Chri≈øt in all his ≈øorrows and ≈øufferings.</p>
            <p>Now for the confirming of this comfortable truth, I need not ≈øpeak much: Many promi≈øes you have in Scripture for it, and what ever God hath promi≈øed, he will certainly make good: Turn to that one promi≈øe in ≈øtead of many, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 43.2. <hi>When thou pa≈ø≈øe≈øt through the water, I will be with thee; through the Rivers, they ≈øhall not overflow thee; when thou walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt through the fire, thou ≈øhalt not be burnt, neither ≈øhall the flame kindle upon thee.</hi> And you ≈øhall find too that the Saints have experienced it in all ages, God hath made it good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jacob</hi> was a man that met with many ≈øharp tryals, God exerci≈øed him with many troubles, you ≈øhall find that when he was going to <hi>Padan-Aram,</hi> and was in a very afflicted condition, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28 15. God comes to him, and ≈øaith, <hi>Behold I am with thee.</hi> Gen. 31.5. His father frowned upon him, but the God of his father helped him: <hi>Jo≈øeph,</hi> Gen. 22.20. his ma≈øter took him, put him into pri≈øon, a place where the Kings pri≈øoners were bound; he was in the Pri≈øon, but the Lord was with <hi>Jo≈øeph.</hi> The Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> was thrown into a Dungeon, but the Scripture ≈øaith, <hi>God
<pb facs="tcp:62760:55"/>was with him.</hi> The three Children was thrown into the Furnace of fire, but there was a fourth with them, and that was the Son of God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Paul</hi> when he was brought to his trial, all men for≈øook him, but God ≈øtood by him. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. So the Chri≈øtians in all their ≈øharp ≈øufferings, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9. they were per≈øecuted, but not for≈øaken; per≈øecuted by men, but not for≈øaken by God. God hath abundantly made out this, and doth ≈øo ≈øtill that he will never leave tho≈øe alone in a time of ≈øuffering, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> the third thing is to ≈øhew you in what re≈øpect God is with ≈øuch: why this pre≈øence of God is an active pre≈øence: God is not meerly with his people, but he is with them in an active way: for this is a certain truth, God is working when the Saints are ≈øuffering, I will open this in ≈øeveral particulars.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, God is with ≈øuch in his teaching pre≈øence. Gods correction and Gods in≈øtruction they u≈øually go together: and where there is the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtenings of Gods hand, there is al≈øo the teaching of Gods Spirit. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 90.12. <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed is the man whom thou cha≈øtene≈øt, and whom thou teache≈øt.</hi> Chri≈øt though he were a Son, yet learned obedience by the things that he ≈øuffered: God teacheth his upright ones many le≈ø≈øons in a time of adver≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which they never learned in a time of pro≈øperity. For we are like idle boys, or bad Scholars that learn be≈øt when the rod is over us: In a pro≈øperous condition God ≈øpeaks to us, and we mind him not, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.21. <hi>I≈øpoke to thee in thy pro≈øperity, but thou woulde≈øt not hear:</hi> and this hath been thy manner from thy youth upwards: in pro≈øperity God ≈øpeaks once and twice, as <hi>Job</hi> ≈øpeaks, but we will not hear; but in the time of adver≈øity God opens the ears, <hi>Jud.</hi> 8.16. As <hi>Gideon</hi> taught the men of <hi>Succoth</hi> with thorns and briers; ≈øo doth God teach his people, by affliction, and oh the many ble≈ø≈øed truths that they learn, when they are under the Rod, when they want liberty! Oh what a mercy is it to have liberty then, when they have not Ordinances as before! what a mercy is it to have Ordinances then! Oh what an evil thing is it then for them, that they have departed from God! God teaches them the≈øe things then: ≈øin is never ≈øo bitter, mercy is never ≈øo ≈øweet as in a time of ≈øuffering: Oh how vain and empty is the creature then! Oh how ≈øweet is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God then! I ≈øay ≈øuch things as the≈øe God teaches then.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God is with ≈øuch in his guiding pre≈øence, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 73.24. <hi>Thou wilt guide me with thy coun≈øel, and afterwards receive me unto glory.</hi> When <hi>I≈ørael</hi> was in the Wilderne≈øs, then they had the cloud to guide them. It is a ble≈ø≈øed thing to live under the conduct and direction of the wi≈øe God; we never have ≈øo much of this as in an hour of tryal: indeed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God never fly ≈øo much to God for direction, as as ≈øuch a

               </gap>ime: as <hi>Saul,</hi> when he was in di≈øtre≈øs then he calls for the Ephod; and thus it is with us under affliction, then we look to God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God is with them in his pre≈øerving and hiding pre≈øence. God is the Saints hiding place, their ≈øhield, their buckler, their rock, their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; the Scripture expre≈ø≈øions are many to hold out Gods protection as to his people: God hath a con≈øtant care over them to pre≈øerve them and ≈øave them; oh but e≈øpecially in a time of trouble: as the Marriner is never ≈øo careful of the Ship, as under a ≈øtorm; and God is never ≈øo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of his Church and people, as under affliction. <hi>Jeremy</hi> is in Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, now God ≈øaves him: <hi>Daniel</hi> is in the Den, now God ≈øaves him: The three Children in the Fire, now God ≈øaves them: <hi>Peter</hi> is in Pri≈øon, now God ≈øaves him: The mother never tends the childe ≈øo carefully as when the childe is ≈øick; and Providence is never ≈øo tender to the People of God, as under a ≈øuffering condition.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, God is with them in his comforting Pre≈øence, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Who comforteth us in all our tribulation,</hi> and u≈øually we have mo≈øt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolation from God, when we have mo≈øt of tribulation from without; as our ≈øufferings do abound, ≈øo our con≈øolations doth abound much more: The childe that is beaten when it is well, is cheri≈øhed when it is ill; when per≈øons are ≈øick, then you give them Cordials: God gives the be≈øt of comforts in the wor≈øt of times; when the burden is heavy upon the back, then the peace of con≈øcience is great within, the wor≈øe it is without, the better it is within: when men di≈øcover mo≈øt of anger, God di≈øcovers mo≈øt of love.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, God is with ≈øuch in his ≈øtrengthening pre≈øence, to enable them and to ≈øupport them to undergoe what ever he is plea≈øed to call them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; this is the way of our good and gracious God; he always gives out ≈øtrength, as he layes on affliction, he never leaves his children alone in this re≈øpect, he will be with them to ≈øupport them: though it may be not to deliver, yet he will certainly be with them to ≈øupport: the Rod and the ≈øtaff they go together, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 23.4. the afflicting Rod and the ≈øupporting ≈øtaff: when one is upon the Saint to afflict, then the other hand is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Saint to ≈øupport: <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 41 10. <hi>I will uphold thee, I will ≈øtrengthen thee, fear not, I will help thee: yea I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteou≈øne≈øs. This David found, I cryed unto the Lord in my di≈øtre≈øs he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered me, and ≈øtrengthened me in my inward man, P≈øal.</hi> 138.3. Oh! when men afflict, God ≈øupports: when men puts the children of God into the deep waters, then God takes them by the chin, and holds them up, that they ≈øhall not ≈øink and be drowned.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, God is with them in his ≈øympathizing pre≈øence: Oh he hath a tender ≈øen≈øe of all the ≈øorrows and calamities of his people! Oh it
<pb facs="tcp:62760:56"/>grieves him that they are grieved! they that touch thim touches the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his eye: in all their afflictions he is afflicted: <hi>Saul, Saul, why per≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute≈øt thou me?</hi> every blow that is given to them, God bears a part of it him≈øelf: as they are ≈øen≈øible of Gods di≈øhonour, ≈øo God is ≈øen≈øible of their ≈øuffering; it pains him to the very heart to ≈øee his children wronged and abu≈øed by a malicious World.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, He is with them by his ≈øanctifying pre≈øence: all their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are to do them good, and to make them good: and therefore the Furnace it is but to refine them from their dro≈ø≈øe: the pruning-hook of affliction it is but to cut off their luxuriant Branches: God takes the ≈øharp knife into his hand and lances them, but it is only to fetch out their corruption. By this ≈øhall the iniquity of <hi>Jacob</hi> be purged, and this is all the fruit, to take away his ≈øin.</p>
            <p>Eightly, God is with them by his quickening pre≈øence, to make their Prayers more fervent, to make their reque≈øts to the Throne of Grace more Importunate. The Children of God cry mo≈øt to him when they ≈øuffer mo≈øt from men, and their prayers are be≈øt when their condition is wor≈øt: Prayer ≈øhortens Affliction, and Affliction heightens Prayer: God is with them to hear their Prayers. Oh the prayer of the Afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that comes up to Heaven! God hears the ≈øighs and groans of his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øed ones, their tears pierce the Heavens, they call upon God in time of trouble, and pour out their ≈øorrows before the Lord, and he doth hear them.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, God is with them by his rai≈øing pre≈øence, to rai≈øe up their hearts higher, to elevate their ≈øouls, and bring them more near to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf. Gods people when they meet with troubles in the World, Oh! no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ≈øo ≈øweet unto them as the enjoyment of God: then no life ≈øo ≈øweet unto them as the life of Faith; then they reli≈øh a ≈øweetne≈øs in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe: then every ≈ømile of God, oh how welcome is it? then all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of their ≈øouls center in God, and run to God: as in Winter-time all the ≈øap of the Tree runs to the root: in Summer-time it ≈øpreads it ≈øelf in the body, but in the Winter goes to the root: when a man is ≈øick, all the blood goes to the heart; ≈øo in a ≈øuffering condition, all the affections of the ≈øoul go to God.</p>
            <p>But now what are the rea≈øons why God will not leave his people that thus de≈øire to plea≈øe him?</p>
            <p>Why, God loves them, therefore he will not leave them; per≈øons we love, we cannot leave, e≈øpecially when they are in a di≈øtre≈ø≈øed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and as God hath ≈øet his love upon them, ≈øo they have ≈øet their love upon him; they love him, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 91.15. you have there an expre≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:56"/>
               <hi>Becau≈øe he hath ≈øet his love upon me, therefore I will deliver him: He ≈øhall call upon me, and I will an≈øwer him, I will be with him in trouble.</hi> God is a God of bowels, of great pity and compa≈ø≈øion, and therefore he will not leave his people in a time of di≈øtre≈øs; you know bowels how they ≈øtand in you towards them that are in mi≈øery; it goes to the heart of a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man to leave a per≈øon in mi≈øery: Oh how great are the bowels and compa≈ø≈øions of God! <hi>It Ephraim my Son, is he a plea≈øant Child? Oh my bowels are turned within me, I will have mercy on him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Such as plea≈øe God, ≈øhall have his pre≈øence under ≈øufferings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe now they need God mo≈øt: if God will not leave his people as to temporal ≈øupplies, becau≈øe they need ≈øuch and ≈øuch things: they need meat, and they need cloathing: ≈øurely much more God will not leave his children, as to ≈øpiritual ≈øupplies, under times of di≈øtre≈øs, becau≈øe then they need God. Oh what can a Believer do, or what can a Believer ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer when God leaves him, his ≈øtrength is in God; his ≈øupport is in God, his comfort is in God, his All is in God: and therefore if God now leave him, what will become of him, he needs God at all times, but never ≈øo much as when his condition is dark and troubled. What was <hi>Samp≈øon,</hi> that man of ≈øo great ≈øtrength, when his hair was gone? and what is a Believer, when his God is gone?</p>
            <p n="3">3. God loves to ≈øee his people chearful in a time of ≈øuffering, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is with them; he loves not that they ≈øhould walk dejectedly. When God is pre≈øent, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> can ≈øing in Pri≈øon: the Apo≈øtles can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, that God honours them to be reproached for him. When God is pre≈øent, the people of God are not only chearful under tribulation, but can glory, their cro≈øs is their Crown; but if God be with-drawn, what can there be? drooping hearts and pen≈øive ≈øorrows.</p>
            <p n="4">4. God will not leave them, becau≈øe they will not leave him; God will not leave them, becau≈øe they ≈øuffer for his ≈øake: were they not ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Gods glory, and careful to plea≈øe him, they might be free from ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering as well as others; but it is for Gods ≈øake they ≈øuffer: <hi>For thy ≈øake we are killed like ≈øheep, all the day long.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>La≈øtly, It is thus, becau≈øe God will make it appear to all the World, that he puts a difference between them that de≈øire to plea≈øe him, and other men; God hath a value for ≈øuch: do but ≈øee how <hi>Ma≈øes</hi> argues the ca≈øe with God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.13. and ≈øo on, where he comes to God with a great reque≈øt, that God will ≈øhew him his way, that he might know it; Why, ≈øaith God to him, <hi>My pre≈øenes ≈øhall go with thee.

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>
                  <hi>John 8.29.</hi>
               </bibl>
               <q>And he that ≈øent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone: for I do always tho≈øe things that plea≈øe him.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>I Was upon the≈øe words in the morning; having ≈øpoken ≈øomething to them as they refer to Chri≈øt, who ≈øpake them here of him≈øelf; I then brought them down to his Members, Believers, and ≈øo propounded this ob≈øervation from them. <hi>That whoever they are that de≈øire to plea≈øe God, to do the things that are plea≈øing to him, God will be with ≈øuch, and the Father will not leave ≈øuch alone, e≈øpecially in a time of ≈øuffering, and trouble.</hi> In the pro≈øecuting of this point, I ≈øpake to four things, which I ≈øhall not now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat, but come to the mark which I intend at pre≈øent; and that is, to make ≈øome Application. 1. Let me endeavour to prevail with every one of you; ≈øo to carry your ≈øelves in your ≈øeveral places and capacities, that whatever you do, you may plea≈øe God.</p>
            <p>It was a ble≈ø≈øed te≈øtimony that was given of <hi>Enoch,</hi> Heb. 11.6. <hi>Before his Tran≈ølation he had this Te≈øtimony; that he plea≈øed God;</hi> Oh! how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py will they be at the great day of Judgment, which ≈øhall be ≈øingled out by Chri≈øt, before Angels and Men; and Chri≈øt ≈øhall ≈øay of them, This was the man, or this was the woman that plea≈øed God! There is a great deal of plea≈øing in the world, but there are but very ≈øew that make this their bu≈øine≈øs, to plea≈øe God; therefore I would have you ≈øhun that which is ≈øinful, and pre≈øs after that which is matter of Duty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are ≈øome that mind nothing but to plea≈øe them≈øelves, to promote their own intere≈øt, to love their own ea≈øe, to indulge them≈øelves in their own carnal delights, but they never mind the good of others, or the plea≈øing of God; the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaks of, and again≈øt the≈øe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are others that look no farther then the plea≈øing of men; if
<pb facs="tcp:62760:57"/>they can but keep fair with men, and ≈øhun the di≈øplea≈øure of men, that is all they aim at: but my Brethren, what a poor thing is it to have man to be your friend, and God to be your enemy? to have the ≈ømiles of a poor dying peri≈øhing worm, and to lye under the frowns of the great God!</p>
            <p>Indeed there is a good plea≈øing of men, to plea≈øe them for their Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.2. and ≈øo the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaks of him≈øelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.32. <hi>Even as I plea≈øe all men in all things,</hi> that is, in all things that are of an indifferent nature, not ≈øimply evil, nor ≈øimply good, in all things.</p>
            <p>This Apo≈øtle was of a yielding and complying ≈øpirit, that he might thereby the better in≈øinuate him≈øelf into the affections of men, and be more in≈øtrumental to the glory of God, in the work of the Go≈øpel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.22. <hi>To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak; I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means ≈øave ≈øome; and this I do for the Go≈øpel ≈øake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now in matter of Duty, ≈øuch things as are expre≈øly determined by God, and ≈øo are either good or evil; in the≈øe things the Apo≈øtle would be no plea≈øer of men: <hi>If I ≈øhould plea≈øe men, I ≈øhould not be the ≈øervant of Chri≈øt.</hi> Gal. 1. It is good to plea≈øe others to their Edification, but we mu≈øt not plea≈øe others to their own ruine and condemnation: It is good to plea≈øe men when we can ≈øo do, and not grieve God. In≈øtead of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing men, let it be your con≈øtant care and be≈øt endeavour in all things to plea≈øe God: my Brethren, this is a duty of ≈øo great importance, that was I now to take my leave of you, and ≈øhould certainly know that I ≈øhould never ≈øpeak to you more, as we are come very near to it, for though I ≈øpeak to you as a living man, yet I ≈øpeak to you as a dying mini≈øter; this I ≈øay, is a duty of that weight and importance, that I know not what to pre≈øs upon you more material then this; con≈øult but two places of Scripture, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. <hi>For this cau≈øe we do not cea≈øe to pray for you.</hi> What was the thing the Apo≈øtle in this his con≈øtant Prayers, did beg of God for them? It was this, That they might plea≈øe God: and when he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his leave in the winding up of his Epi≈øtle to the <hi>Hebrews, Now the God of Peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Je≈øus, the great Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd of the ≈øheep, through the blood of the everla≈øting covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well-plea≈øing in his ≈øight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not go beyond the Text for Motives to ≈øtir you up to the≈øe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours: For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Motive.</hi> 1. Fir≈øt con≈øider what that God is, which I would have you
<pb facs="tcp:62760:58"/>endeavour to plea≈øe. He is that God which made heaven and earth, that God before whom all the world is as nothing, but as a little du≈øt in the ballance, and as a drop of water to the bucket; that God whom Angels adore and wor≈øhip; that God who by a word from his mouth is able to bring the whole Univer≈øe into nothing: will you not ≈øtudy to plea≈øe this God? But further, con≈øider what this God is to you; He is the Fountain of your being, he is the God of all your mercies, he is your Creatour and Sovereign, he is your Maker and Law-giver. It is he that by a ≈ømile can make you happy, and by a frown can make you mi≈øerable; it is he that hath Heaven and Hell at his di≈øpo≈øal, <hi>who openeth and none can ≈øhut, who ≈øhuts and none can open.</hi> He that mu≈øt judge every one of you, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to eternal ble≈ø≈øedne≈øs, or el≈øe to eternal torments; it is he in who≈øe hands your breath, your life, your ≈øoul, your All is; will you not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to plea≈øe this God? as the Prophet argueth in point of fear. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 51.12. <hi>Who art thou, that art afraid of a man that ≈øhall dye, or of the Son of man that ≈øhall be made as gra≈øs, and forgette≈øt the Lord thy maker?</hi> Oh poor Creature! who art thou that goe≈øt about to plea≈øe a mortal dying man, and do≈øt not go about to plea≈øe the great God, thy Creator and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign!</p>
            <p n="2">2. Con≈øider that relation wherein you profe≈øs your ≈øelves to ≈øtand to God: he is your Ma≈øter, you his ≈øervants: he is your Father, you his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: he is your Lord, you his ≈øubjects: You know all that are in clo≈øe relations will ≈øtudy to plea≈øe them that are above them; as the ≈øervant his Ma≈øter, the childe his Father, the ≈øubject his Prince: All per≈øons that are in a ≈øtate of inferiority, will ≈øtudy to plea≈øe their ≈øuperiors, e≈øpecially when they do depend upon them. Oh! how infiuitely is God above tho≈øe relations. Alas, there is but a very little di≈øtance betwixt you and your ≈øervants, and yet you expect they ≈øhould plea≈øe you, will you not therefore plea≈øe God? e≈øpecially con≈øidering your dependance upon him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You ≈øhall not loo≈øe by plea≈øing God: that is enough to put us upon this: He that plea≈øeth God profiteth him≈øelf: in that very act wherein we plea≈øe God, we profit our ≈øelves: men can do but little for us, yet for what they can do, we ≈øtudy to plea≈øe them. Let me open this in a few particulars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. If you will ≈øincerely endeavour in all things to plea≈øe God, God will give you a gracious return to all your prayers. Oh what a mercy is this for a man to have his prayers an≈øwered by God! 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.22 <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we ask, we receive of him, becau≈øe we keep his Commandements, and do tho≈øe things that are plea≈øing in his ≈øight.</hi> Never expect that God ≈øhould
<pb facs="tcp:62760:58"/>hear any prayers, if we do not endeavour to do tho≈øe things that plea≈øe him.</item>
               <item>2. Do you plea≈øe God, then he will plea≈øe you: mercy plea≈øeth us, and duty plea≈øeth God. Now when we plea≈øe God in a way of duty, he will plea≈øe us in a way of mercy: If we order our ways ≈øo as to plea≈øe God, he will order his ways ≈øo as to plea≈øe us.</item>
               <item>3. Great is the benefit of plea≈øing God, even as to men: and this <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ≈øets before you, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.7. <hi>When a mans ways plea≈øe the Lord, he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him;</hi> and he hath ≈øuch another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.11. <hi>He that loveth purene≈øs of heart, the King ≈øhall be his Friend:</hi> the meaning of this Scripture is this, when we keep clo≈øe to God, and walk in compliance with his Will, and make it our great de≈øign to plea≈øe him, he will give us to ≈øind favour in the eyes of men. He that maketh God his friend, God will make that mans Enemies to be his friends. Men are po≈ø≈øibly full of anger, revenge, and exa≈øperation; be it ≈øo: Do you de≈øire to plea≈øe God? God can turn their hearts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you; God can ≈øweeten them in their ≈øpirits, and take away that venome that is in them; ≈øo you know he did in the ca≈øe of <hi>E≈øan</hi> to his Brother <hi>Jacob.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. This is the way to Heaven and Happine≈øs; God will be plea≈øed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ≈øinner ≈øhall be ≈øaved, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>Enoch</hi> before his tran≈ølation had this Te≈øtimony, <hi>That he plea≈øed God:</hi> there is no way to Heaven but this, the Child plea≈øes the Father, and then the Father gives him the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. So it is here.</item>
               <item>5. Let me return to the Argument in the Text; God will never leave them alone, that de≈øire ≈øincerely to plea≈øe him. Methinks this ≈øhould be a very prevailing motive to you, e≈øpecially now; plea≈øe God, and he will never leave you, no not in a time of di≈øtre≈øs and trouble. Here is the great difference betwixt a faithful God, and a fal≈øe man.</item>
            </list>
            <p>In time of trouble and adver≈øity men leave us and for≈øake us; in time of pro≈øperity then they flatter us, and pretend a great deal of friend≈øhip and kindne≈øs: but as no man looks upon a Dial when the Sun is under a cloud; ≈øo the≈øe very men that pretend ≈øo much of kindne≈øs and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip, if ≈øo be we do but come under a frown, or into trouble, then their friend≈øhip and kindne≈øs is at an end, as <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaid; No man ≈øtood by him when he came to be tried before <hi>Nero,</hi> all men for≈øook him, but God did not for≈øake him. The wi≈øe man hath an expre≈ø≈øion. <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.17. <hi>A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adver≈øity;</hi> but where ≈øhall we find ≈øuch a friend, or indeed ≈øuch a brother? But now if you will plea≈øe God, he will ≈øtand by you, when all men leave you, when you
<pb facs="tcp:62760:59"/>have the greate≈øt need of God, he will then ≈øtand by you; if you be in a Pri≈øon, he will be with you; if you be bani≈øhed, he will be with you: if ≈øin doth not part God and you, certainly no affliction ≈øhall part God and you.</p>
            <p>Study to plea≈øe God; oh! is it not a ≈øad thing for God to leave you? that is the ≈øadde≈øt of all; when we lo≈øe God, then we lo≈øe all, <hi>Ho≈ø.</hi> 9.12. <hi>Woe unto them when I depart from them.</hi> What are all the mercies if God leave you? no more then if a man had a fair plea≈øant Hou≈øe, and ≈øhould never ≈øee the Sun more.</p>
            <p>Oh do the things that always plea≈øe the Lord! and he will never leave you; under mercies, under afflictions he will be with you, and then your mercies ≈øhall be very ≈øweet, and your afflictions ≈øhall not be very bitter. You know how earne≈øt <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> was, <hi>Num.</hi> 10.13. with his father in law <hi>Hobab</hi> the <hi>Midianite; Leave us not I pray thee, fora≈ømuch as thou knowe≈øt how we are to encamp in the wilderne≈øs, and thou maye≈øt be to us as eyes.</hi> Oh keep God to you! e≈øpecially when you are entering into the wilderne≈øs of trouble; God will be to you in ≈øtead of eyes, he will be your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øellour, your Comforter, your Guide, your Trea≈øure, your Portion, your All.</p>
            <p>I might add one thing more in the la≈øt place.</p>
            <p>Study to plea≈øe God, becau≈øe he is ≈øo ea≈øie to be plea≈øed, this is a motive to us to endeavour to plea≈øe tho≈øe per≈øons who are ea≈øie to be plea≈øed; a child that hath a father that is ea≈øie to be plea≈øed, a ≈øervant that hath a ma≈øter that is ea≈øie to be plea≈øed, will ≈øtudy to plea≈øe them. Sincerity plea≈øeth God, though in the mid≈øt of much infirmity; he is ≈øo gracious and merciful, that what≈øoever a poor ≈øinner doth but de≈øire to plea≈øe God, he will accept of tho≈øe de≈øires: If we can but plea≈øe God, it is no great matter whether we plea≈øe men or not.</p>
            <p>I ≈øhall conclude this branch with 1 <hi>The≈ø.</hi> 4.1. <hi>We be≈øeech you brethren, and exhort you in the Lord Je≈øus, that as you have received of us, how you ought to walk and plea≈øe God, that you would abound more and more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øe.</hi> 2. By way of direction, I ≈øhould here ≈øhew you how you are to plea≈øe God. I told you in general in the morning, this plea≈øing of God lyeth in two things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. In ≈øuitablene≈øs to his Name.</item>
               <item>2. In ≈øubjection to his Law.</item>
            </list>
            <p>If you will plea≈øe God in all your actions, look to this, That what you do may bear ≈øome re≈øemblance to his Nature, and hold forth obedience to his Law.</p>
            <p>Con≈øult the will of God, and in all things act in conformity to that will, do not allow your ≈øelves in the Commi≈ø≈øion of any known ≈øin, for
<pb facs="tcp:62760:59"/>that will certainly di≈øplea≈øe God: as it was ≈øaid of <hi>David</hi> when he took <hi>Bath≈øheba</hi> to Wife: but ≈øaith the Text, <hi>the thing di≈øplea≈øed the Lord.</hi> Do not Bank any known duty, for that will di≈øplea≈øe God.</p>
            <p>In a word, be holy in all manner of conver≈øation.</p>
            <p>This being too general, I ≈øhall not in≈øi≈øt upon it; only in a word more particularly.</p>
            <p>Do tho≈øe things now, now make con≈øcience of tho≈øe duties which now lie upon you, in the doing of which you will certainly plea≈øe God: and they are ≈øuch as the≈øe.</p>
            <p>Be ≈øtedfa≈øt in the ways of God, in the mid≈øt of a back-≈øliding and apo≈øtatizing age, ≈øtand fa≈øt to the Law of God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Contend for the faith which is delivered to the Saints,</hi> ver 3. of the Epi≈øtle of <hi>Jude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Be not a≈øhamed to own Chri≈øt before all the world; if you be a≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of him on earth, he will be a≈øhamed of you in Heaven; and wo be to that ≈øinner whom Chri≈øt is a≈øhamed to own.</p>
            <p>Reckon reproaches for the name of Chri≈øt, better than the plea≈øure of ≈øin that is but for a ≈øea≈øon</p>
            <p>When God calleth you to it, a≈ø≈øert the purity and ≈øpirituality of Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-wor≈øhip; do not place Religion in a ≈øew ≈øhadows where the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance is neglected; but chiefly minde ≈øelf-denial, mortification, crucifixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the world, keeping up clo≈øe communion with God, love the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God whatever the world ≈øay or think of thee; for God is highly plea≈øed when he ≈øeeth his Children loved.</p>
            <p>Keep up Religion in your Families, whatever ≈øcorn or contempt is ca≈øt upon you. Oh that you would labour to be of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ≈øpirit; <hi>I know,</hi> ≈øaith God, <hi>he will command his Children and his Hou≈øhold after him, and they ≈øhall keep the way of the Lord,</hi> Gen 18.19.</p>
            <p>I do not know any one better means for the keeping up Religion in this Nation, than for Ma≈øters of Families to be con≈øciencious in the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of this duty:</p>
            <p>Be good in bad times; be patterns of good works to tho≈øe that ≈øhall behold you. Let no reproach or obloquy make you to abate your exact walking with God; whatever you meet withall in the ways of holine≈øs and a ≈øtrict life, ≈øay, If this be to be vile, I will be more vile. Make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience of a ≈øtrict ob≈øervation of the <hi>Lords day;</hi> take heed of that Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ≈øtealing away holy times; of pro≈øtituting that to common and civil u≈øes, which is impropriated and dedicated to the ≈øervice of God.</p>
            <p>Pray for, and love all tho≈øe that have been in≈øtrumental for your ≈øpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good in the work of the Mini≈øtry, whatever dirt is now thrown in their faces, and though you never get more good by them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:60"/>Forget not to di≈øtribute to the nece≈ø≈øities of Gods people, that are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them in a low condition; for this is a ≈øacrifice of a ≈øweet odour, and well-plea≈øing to him. Carry your ≈øelves with all patience and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian meekne≈øs towards them that wrong you: pray for them that are your enemies, and when you are reviled, revile not again, but commit your ≈øelves to that God who judgeth righteou≈øly.</p>
            <p>Do your duty to your ≈øuperiors, and to tho≈øe that are in Authority.</p>
            <p>So carry your ≈øelves that it may be with you as it was with <hi>Daniel;</hi> they had nothing again≈øt him, ≈øaving in the matter of his God.</p>
            <p>Bank not any duty for ≈øuffering, choo≈øe the greate≈øt of ≈øuffering, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the lea≈øt of ≈øin.</p>
            <p>In a word, ≈øo walk as it becometh the Go≈øpel. And finally I ≈øpeak to you as the Apo≈øtle ≈øpoke to them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Hold forth the word of life, that I may rejoyce in the day of Chri≈øt, that I have not run in vain, nor labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third u≈øe is for comfort, to all tho≈øe that do con≈øcienciou≈øly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour in all things to plea≈øe God: the comfort lies in this, you may ≈øuffer, but when ever you ≈øuffer, the Father will not leave you alone. Plea≈øing of God does not ≈øecure a man from ≈øuffering from men, ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it rather expo≈øes a man to ≈øuffer from men: But now though it does not prevent ≈øuffering, yet it takes away the ≈øting and venome of ≈øuffering; it makes it to be like <hi>Samp≈øons</hi> Lion, when it was ≈ølain, he found nothing but honey in the belly of it: Oh! the pre≈øence of God in a time of affliction is exceeding precious, it turns gall into honey, thorns into ro≈øes. Be not troubled in your thoughts about what you may undergo: if God be with you, all will be well: if God comes when the Cro≈ø≈øes cometh, the weight of it will not hurt you: what is a Pri≈øon when God is there? My brethren, though e≈øtate leave you, relations leave you, all your comforts leave you, ≈øo long as God doth not leave you, it will be be well: therefore do not fear, be not dejected, or di≈øcouraged. <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 43. 1, 2. <hi>Fear not, O Jacob,</hi> why ≈øo? <hi>when thou pa≈ø≈øe≈øt through the water, I will be with thee:</hi> We have more rea≈øon to be afraid of pro≈øperity with Gods ab≈øence, than of adver≈øity with Gods pre≈øence. A good God will make every condition to be good; it is not a pri≈øon but a palace where God is; they that do the things that plea≈øe God, whatever condition they may be brought to, the Father will not leave them alone. Mini≈øters may leave you, the means of Grace and Ordinances in a great mea≈øure may leave you, your creature-enjoyments and comforts may leave you; but here is a God that will never leave you: Oh! ble≈øs his holy name.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Is this plea≈øing of God, a duty of ≈øo great importance and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit? then be tender and charitable in judging of tho≈øe that do differ
<pb facs="tcp:62760:60"/>from you and others, upon this account, becau≈øe they dare not di≈øplea≈øe God. I may in this caution, aim at my ≈øelf and others of my brethren in the work of our Mini≈øtry: but I am not here at pre≈øent to take my la≈øt fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel; I hope I may have a little further opportunity of ≈øpeaking to you: but if not, let me require this of you, to pa≈øs a charitable interpretation upon your laying down the exerci≈øe of our Mini≈øtry: there is a greater Judge than you, mu≈øt judge us all at the great day; and to this Judge we can appeal before Angels and men, that it is not this thing, or that thing, that puts us upon this di≈ø≈øent, but it is con≈øcience toward God, and fear of offending him. I cen≈øure none that differ from me, as though they di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øe God: but yet, as to my ≈øelf, ≈øhould I do thus and thus, I ≈øhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly violate the peace of my own cou≈øcience, and offend God, which I mu≈øt not do, no, not to ≈øecure my Mini≈øtry, though that either is, or ought to be, dearer to me than my very life: and how dear it is, God only know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Do not add affliction to affliction, be not uncharitable in judging of us, as if through pride, faction, ob≈øtinacy, or devotedne≈øs to a party, or which is wor≈øe than all, in oppo≈øion to Authority, we do di≈ø≈øent; the Judge of all hearts knows it is not ≈øo: but it is meerly from tho≈øe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen≈øions which after prayer, and the u≈øe of all means do yet continue; that doing thus and thus, we ≈øhould di≈øplea≈øe God: therefore deal chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably with us, in this day of our affliction: If we be mi≈øtaken, I pray God to convince us: if others be mi≈øtaken, whether in a publick or private ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, I pray God in mercy convince them: but however things go, God will make good this truth to us; in this work he will not leave us, and our Father will not leave us alone; for it is the unfeigned de≈øire of our ≈øoul, in all things to plea≈øe God.</p>

            <p>IT would give light to the≈øe words, if you con≈øider the ≈øcope and de≈øign of the Apo≈øtle in this Epi≈øtle to the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> the ≈øumme of which is, he writes to them that he might animate their ≈øpirits again≈øt <hi>apo≈øtacy from the Doctrine of the Go≈øpel;</hi> they were liable to this from you and others,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:61"/>upon this account, becau≈øe they dare not di≈øplea≈øe God, I may in this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aim at my ≈øelf and other of my brethren, this upon a double account.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Partly in re≈øpect of tho≈øe per≈øecutions to which they were expo≈øed; for the <hi>Jews</hi> were filled with a bruiti≈øh zeal, for the Ceremonies of the Levitical Law, and expre≈øt the greate≈øt rancour again≈øt tho≈øe, who le≈øt <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> to follow <hi>Chri≈øt:</hi> This is the rea≈øon why the Apo≈øtle lays down ≈øo many pre≈øervatives again≈øt their revolting from Religion; and he ≈øpends one part of this Epi≈øtle in a mo≈øt pa≈ø≈øionate Exhortation to per≈øeverance, and doth in the tenth Chapter in≈øinuate him≈øelf into them: You have already ta≈øted the fir≈øt-fruits of affliction, <hi>ver.</hi> 3.4. <hi>You took joyfully the ≈øpoyling of your goods, knowing in your ≈øelves, that you have in Heaven a better and an enduring ≈øub≈øtance.</hi> This is that temper that Martyrs have expre≈øt, who have not only parted with their goods, but with their lives for the Go≈øpel: When they came to the Stake, they would not ≈øo much as ≈øhed a tear, to quench tho≈øe flames wherein they ≈øhould a≈øcend to God, as in a fiery Chariot: <hi>You took joyfully the ≈øpoiling of your goods, knowing in your ≈øelves, that you have a better and an enduring ≈øub≈øtance.</hi> Thus he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øinuates him≈øelf, by repre≈øenting what they had done, to encourage them to per≈øeverance: and partly he fortifies them again≈øt <hi>Back-≈øliding,</hi> by tho≈øe terrible judgements which he threatned again≈øt <hi>Revolters,</hi> as you read <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.7.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As they were liable to this Apo≈øtacy upon the account of <hi>Per≈øecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> ≈øo upon the account of the un≈øettledne≈øs and in≈øtability of their own ≈øpirits. There were ≈øeveral of tho≈øe who had given up their names to Chri≈øt, who did compare the Ceremonies of the Law with the purity of the Go≈øpel: Now the Apo≈øtle, to ≈øecure them from this mixture, his great de≈øign is to repre≈øent the vanity and infectivene≈øs of all the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law, and to expre≈øs and prove the virtue and efficacy of the Lord Je≈øus his death, which was the ≈øub≈øtance of all the ≈øhadows. And this takes up one great part of his di≈øcour≈øe with them.</p>
            <p>Now in the≈øe two ver≈øes he ≈øums up, by way of Recapitulation, all that which he had di≈øcour≈øed of at large, and in them you may ob≈øerve the≈øe two things.</p>

               <item>1. A de≈øcription of God, to whom he addre≈ø≈øes this Prayer.</item>

            </list>
            <p>The <hi>De≈øcription of God,</hi> that he amplifies by the≈øe two things:
<list>
                  <item>1. From the Attributes and Qualities of God, (if I may ≈øo expre≈øs it) <hi>Now</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>the God of Peace.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. From the effects of his power and love; <hi>That brought again from the dead our Lord Je≈øus, that great Shepherd of the Sheep.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:61"/>And the≈øe Titles, they are not here ≈øet down by the Apo≈øtle to adorn his di≈øcour≈øe, meerly as an ornament, but they have all a peculiar efficacy, as to the obtaining of the reque≈øt which here he makes for them.</p>
            <p>I ≈øhall begin with the fir≈øt, the <hi>De≈øcription of God</hi> from that Attribute. <hi>(Now the God of Peace)</hi> the Title that is u≈øed in the <hi>Old Te≈øtament</hi> frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is this, <hi>(The Lord of Ho≈øts)</hi> but in the <hi>New</hi> he is called, <hi>The God of peace.</hi> There were darker repre≈øentations of the mercy and love of God than, the more full di≈øcoveries of his grace were re≈øerved till the coming of Chri≈øt. Their di≈øcoveries under the <hi>Old Te≈øtament</hi> were but as the <hi>Day-≈øtar,</hi> which u≈øhered in the <hi>Sun of Righteou≈øne≈øs.</hi> Now this title of the <hi>God of Peace</hi> imparts two things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That he is the <hi>Author of Peace,</hi> and works it.</item>
               <item>2. That he <hi>loves</hi> and <hi>delights</hi> in peace.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Fir≈øt, That he s the Author of it: And if you con≈øider <hi>Peace</hi> in all its notions and kinds, it is a fruit of God: and that which de≈øcends from him.
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Peace in Nature</hi> is the harmony that is between all the parts of the World, the union that is between the di≈øagreeing Elements that is from God: for without him, the whole Creation would pre≈øently disband, and return to its fir≈øt Chaos of confu≈øion.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Civil Peace,</hi> which is among the Societies of men, that which is ≈øo amiable and lovely, and which needs no other foil to commend it, and ≈øet off its lu≈øtre, than the mi≈øeries and cruelties of war; this peace comes from God likewi≈øe. Every ra≈øh hand is able to make a wound, or to ca≈øt a Fire-brand, but it is only the <hi>God of Peace</hi> that is able to heal breaches, and to allay tho≈øe ≈øtorms that are in a Nation. You know tho≈øe ≈øhowers which render the Earth fruitful de≈øcend from Heaven, from God; ≈øo all the coun≈øels of peace de≈øcend from above. The fiery Exaltations a≈øcend from the Earth, Coun≈øels of War &amp; di≈øtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, proceeded from the devili≈øh hearts of men. Or,</item>
                  <item>3. If you con≈øider that <hi>Rational Peace,</hi> which is in the ≈øpirits of men: that is, when the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding exerci≈øes a coertion and re≈øtraint over our licentious appetites, when all our inferior Faculties are under the empire and conduct of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon; this proceeds al≈øo from God: For, ≈øince the fall, there is a great deal of tumult, many riots and di≈øorders in the ≈øoul of a man: <hi>Rea≈øon</hi> hates a bad Guide, and our <hi>Appetites</hi> tho≈øe are evil in≈øtruments, and ≈øo many times hurry Rea≈øon from its regular actings. But,</item>
                  <item>4. much more if you con≈øider <hi>Spiritual Peace,</hi> that peace doth not only import an Agreement of a man within him≈øelf, but the Agreement of the ≈øoul with God.</item>
               </list> This is the fruit of the Spirit, and it is only God that is able to convey this peace to us. And upon a particular account this Title is given to him, by way of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency and property: as,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:62"/>1. He is alone able to allow and di≈øpence this peace unto us, for all our ≈øins are injuries committed again≈øt him, again≈øt the Crown and Dignity; all the Arre≈øts of Con≈øcience are made in the Name of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis only he that can ≈øpeak peace. As in the civil ≈øtate, it is an Act of Supremacy to give a pardon: only he that can condemn is able to ≈øpeak pardon; ≈øo it is our God that is our Judge, provoked and incen≈øed by us, he hath a judicial power to ca≈øt Body and Soul into Hell fire: is alone able to ≈øpeak peace, and pa≈øs a pardon for us in the Court of Heaven, and this is experienced by a wounded ≈øpirit: It is ju≈øt with ≈øuch a per≈øon as with a Malefactour, who ≈øtands condemned at the Bar, he cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive encouragement from any of his ≈øpectators, till the <hi>Judge</hi> ≈øpeak peace unto him: So if an Angel from Heaven ≈øhould come and ≈øpeak to a wounded Spirit: it were impo≈ø≈øible, unle≈øs God did order, command, and di≈øpence it, that the Spirit ≈øhould receive any peace, becau≈øe our ≈øins are immediately committed again≈øt him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He is alone able to reveal and di≈øcover it; there is nothing harder in the World, than to calm and quiet a di≈øturbed Con≈øcience? it mu≈øt be the ≈øame power that makes light to ≈øpring out of darkne≈øs that mu≈øt cau≈øe a chearful ≈øerenity in a dark and di≈øcon≈øolate Soul. I know there is nothing more ea≈øie than that <hi>fal≈øe peace</hi> which is ≈øo univer≈øal in the world; for the mo≈øt among≈øt us cheat them≈øelves with pre≈øumption, in≈øtead of peace with God, and ≈øecurity in≈øtead of peace with Con≈øcience, but that peace which is ≈øolid and true, can only be revealed by God him≈øelf. We have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance of this in <hi>David, P≈øal.</hi> 51. although <hi>Nathan</hi> had told him from God, <hi>Thy ≈øin is pardoned;</hi> yet notwith≈øtanding he ≈øaith, <hi>Make thou me to hear joy and gladne≈øs, that the bones which thou ha≈øt broken may rejoyce.</hi> He ≈øtill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre≈ø≈øes him≈øelf to God, that he would cau≈øe him to hear the voice of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and reconciliation: for his ≈øoul could not be quiet by the voice of the Prophet. There is ≈øo much infidelity in the ≈øoul of a man, that when he comes to take a view of his ≈øins in all their bloody aggravations, only the Spirit of God him≈øelf, is able to allay the terrors of the Con≈øcience: And this he doth by an over-powering Light, when he doth in an impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and commanding manner, ≈øilence all the doubts of the ≈øoul, and re≈øtabli≈øh it in peace with God. Certainly, he that ≈øhall but con≈øider the terrors, the faintings, the palene≈øs of a wounded Con≈øcience, when you ≈øhall ≈øee a per≈øon di≈ø-reli≈øh all the things of this World upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>fearing le≈øt God is his enemy,</hi> when all di≈øcour≈øes that are addre≈øs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him are ineffectual, and but like warm cloaths, to a dead carka≈ø≈øe,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:62"/>cannot in≈øpire any heat into him. This ≈øhews, only God is able to reveal peace. So <hi>Job, If he hide his face, who is able to be at peace?</hi> There needs no other fury to compleat the mi≈øery of a man than his own accu≈øing Con≈øcience: Con≈øcience is a verier Devil than the Devil him≈øelf, and able more to torment and la≈øh the creature. Therefore, if that be once awakened, 'tis only God, to who≈øe Tribunal Con≈øcience is liable, which is able to ≈øpeak peace to the ≈øoul. Now you ≈øee in what re≈øpect this Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>[The God of Peace]</hi> is attributed to him as he is the Author and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As he loves and delights in peace. This is that which is ≈øo plea≈øing to him, that he adopts tho≈øe into the Line of Heaven, who are Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, for they ≈øhall be called the children of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.6.

God he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delights in the reflection of <hi>his own Image;</hi> for tho≈øe things that we admire in the World, and delight in, do not affect his heart: <hi>He delights not in the ≈øtrength of the Hor≈øe, he takes no plea≈øure in the legs of a man: the Lord taketh plea≈øure in them that fear him, in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You may judge of his delight in peace by this: It is that grace which in an e≈øpecial manner prepares us for communion with him: for we can never really honour or enjoy him, unle≈øs we bring to him tho≈øe di≈øpo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which (if I may ≈øo ≈øpeak) are in him≈øelf. And therefore it is no wonder that tho≈øe have little <hi>peace of Con≈øcience,</hi> who make ≈øo little <hi>Con≈øcience of Peace.</hi> You know when God appeared to <hi>Elijah,</hi> he did not appear in the <hi>≈øtorm,</hi> nor in the <hi>fire,</hi> but in the ≈ømall ≈øtill voice, and when <hi>Eli≈øha</hi> was tran≈øported with anger, he was fain to allay that pa≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Mu≈øick, that ≈øo he might be prepared for the holy motions of the Spirit, he called for an In≈øtrument, and then the Spirit moved in him; I bring it for this end, to ≈øhew, <hi>how God delights in Peace,</hi> and he will only maintain communion with tho≈øe that are of calm and peaceable ≈øpirits. So much way as we give to anger, ≈øo much proportionably do we let in the Devil, and ca≈øt out the God of peace.</p>
            <p>Now, the rea≈øon why this Title is given to God, is upon a double ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, partly with re≈øpect to the <hi>Bloud of the everla≈øting Covenant,</hi> which made peace between God and us; partly with re≈øpect to the Covenant it it ≈øelf, which is founded in that Bloud.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In re≈øpect of the <hi>Bloud of the everla≈øting Covenant.</hi> For it was the bloud of Chri≈øt that hath ≈øprinkled Gods Throne, and made peace in
<pb facs="tcp:62760:63"/>Heaven. You ≈øhall read therefore when Chri≈øt came into the World, 'tis ≈øaid, (<hi>Luke</hi> 2.14.) that the Heavenly ho≈øt appeared and ≈øang, <hi>Glory to God in the highe≈øt, and on earth peace,</hi> &amp;c. Since the fall God and man are enemies, there is a reciprocal enmity between God and man: God hates the creature as it is unholy, and man hates God as he is ju≈øt, the avenger of ≈øin, the Author of the Law: Now Chri≈øt was the Umpire that compo≈øed this difference, he was God and man in one per≈øon, and ≈øo being allyed to both, he was a fit per≈øon to reconcile both. He was (as <hi>Job</hi> ≈øpeaks) a days-man between us. He hath paid every farthing that was due; for he did not compound with God, but paid the utmo≈øt that was due to him; He it is that hath reconciled us to God by the power of his ≈øpirit, in changing and renewing our Natures, and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in us tho≈øe di≈øpo≈øitions which are like to God; ≈øo that his bloud is the foundation of this peace. And now, God appears to us not as a <hi>Con≈øuming Fire,</hi> but as a <hi>Refre≈øhing Light,</hi> full of calmne≈øs, ≈øerenity, and peace towards us. Chri≈øt hath brought more honour to God by his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, than we brought di≈øhonor by our tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion; and therefore without any injury to God, he might be at peace with us. You know all our ≈øins were but the acts of finite Creatures, and only infinite in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the object again≈øt whom they were committed. But the Bloud of Chri≈øt was of infinite value in regard of the Subject; for, he was God, and the enriching union of the Deity conveyed ≈øuch worth and value to his bloud, that he was able to appea≈øe God, and not only to free us from condemnation, but to make us the favorites of God. We are not only pardoned, but preferred upon the account of his Bloud.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He is the God of peace, as with re≈øpect to the bloud of Chri≈øt, which is the purcha≈øe of peace; ≈øo with re≈øpect to the Covenant which is made between God and us, <hi>[Through the bloud of the everla≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant,]</hi> there are three ≈øorts of Covenants among≈øt men; ≈øome are <hi>Covenants</hi> of <hi>Friend≈øhip</hi> and <hi>Amity,</hi> ≈øome are <hi>Covenants</hi> of <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Commerce,</hi> and ≈øome are <hi>Covenants</hi> of <hi>A≈ø≈øi≈øtance</hi> and <hi>Help.</hi> Now all the≈øe qualifications meet in this Covenant which is made between God and Believers: it is a Covenant of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Friend≈øhip,</hi> for now we ≈øtand upon terms of amity with God. Tho≈øe who were ≈øtrangers and enemies are now reconciled. And there is between God and us perfect peace; there is a League (as the Scripture ≈øpeaks) between God and the Creature. It is the Covenant of Trade, there is now a way open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> And it is a Covenant of A≈ø≈øi≈øtance, for he promi≈øes nor only to
<pb facs="tcp:62760:63"/>give us the reward of the Covenant, but to ≈øecure unto us the condition, he promi≈øes to enable us to di≈øcharge the condition of Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Now upon this account of that Covenant which is founded in the bloud of Chri≈øt, he is the <hi>God of Peace</hi> to his people.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øe</hi> is by way of <hi>Conviction.</hi> This may di≈øcover to us how di≈øtant their temper is from God, who are enemies to peace. We un-man our ≈øelves; We unchri≈øtian our ≈øelves ≈øo far as we are oppo≈øite to this ble≈ø≈øed temper of peace. Certainly as di≈øturbed Water cannot make any reflection unto us of that face that looks into it; ≈øo when our ≈øpirits are di≈øturbed by animo≈øities, exa≈øperations, heats and divi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, 'tis impo≈ø≈øible for us to ≈øee the Image of God, as he is the God of Peace. And certainly there is no more doleful con≈øideration in the World than this, That man whom God made ≈øo ≈øociable a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who hath all the engagements and endearments laid upon him, which may cau≈øe him to live in Peace and gentlene≈øs towards tho≈øe who are of the ≈øame nature with him; yet that in fiercene≈øs of our hearts, ≈øhould exceed tho≈øe of the mo≈øt Savage creatures. Man comes into the World naked, and altogether unarmed, as if he were de≈øign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the picture of Peace; but could you look into the hearts of men, you would find there ≈øuch tumults, ≈øuch divi≈øions, ≈øuch ≈øeeds of enmity again≈øt their fellow-creatures, that Tygers and Lyons are Calm and peaceable in compari≈øon of them. Now how is this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant from the temper of the God of peace? 'Tis very ≈øtrange to con≈øider that when promi≈øes are made to bury all differences as rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi≈øh under the foundation, that neverthele≈øs the great Work of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny per≈øons ≈øhould be only to revive tho≈øe former animo≈øities, to make tho≈øe exa≈øperations fre≈øh and keen upon their own ≈øpirits; but is this to imitate the God of peace? The≈øe to promote divi≈øions and di≈øturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances among≈øt us, clothe their enemies with the Livery of ≈øhame and reproach, that ≈øo they may be baited by their Fury, that make it their de≈øign to repre≈øent that Party which they think is di≈ø≈øonant from them, with the mo≈øt odious appearances (you know this is the old Art) and tho≈øe ≈øhowres of Calumnies which are in the World, they u≈øually precede the ≈øtorm of per≈øecution. The Devil was fir≈øt a Lier, and then a Murtherer; and tho≈øe who are of this Seed, they follow his Art. In the Primitive times, all the Per≈øecutions of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens aro≈øe from the reproaches of Chri≈øtians: ≈øo it is now. It is an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øie thing to bla≈øt the name of tho≈øe per≈øons, who are de≈øign'd for ruine. But if the contending Parties would con≈øider, (if I may call one Party contending, which is only liable to Penalties, and is re≈øolved to bear
<pb facs="tcp:62760:64"/>them patiently) how unlike this is to that God of peace, methinks it ≈øhould allay the rancour that is in mens ≈øpirits, and make an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between all the differences and divi≈øions that is among≈øt them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If onely Peace come from God, you may from hence take a tryal of that peace that is within you, (for hither to I have been only di≈øcour≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of civil peace) whether it be an effect of this God of Peace. I know nothing more common in the world than pre≈øumption; there is a fal≈øe Peace which doth not ari≈øe from the knowledge of a mans happine≈øs, but from the ignorance of this mi≈øery: Peace, which is only like a Torch to ≈øhine in the night, or like Players that glitter only by Torch-light: ≈øo is the fal≈øe peace men cheri≈øh in their bo≈øom, meerly upon this account, becau≈øe they do not bring their ≈øouls to the light of the Word, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had it from this God of peace, becau≈øe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. God never ≈øpeaks peace to a ≈øoul, but in the way of holine≈øs and obedience: And therefore you ≈øhall find 'tis the coun≈øel of the Scripture, <hi>Acquaint thy ≈øelf with God, and be at peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our peace is found in the way of Duty; and there are none who are more ble≈ø≈øed with the peace of con≈øcience, than tho≈øe who with the greate≈øt fervour, frequency, and delight, maintain communion with God in holy duties. For, a friend≈øhip among men is cheri≈øhed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved by vi≈øits and conver≈øations, ≈øo our peace with God is pre≈øerved by tho≈øe vi≈øits we make to heaven in our prayers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That peace that comes from God, always cau≈øes in us a war with ≈øin, for Gods Covenant with us is Offen≈øive and Defen≈øive; and therefore it is impo≈ø≈øible any per≈øon ≈øhould have true and ≈øolid peace, that waking tranquility of ≈øoul, which is the reward of holine≈øs and obedience, that entertains ≈øin; for every ≈øin thou do≈øt wilfully commit, 'tis an act of ho≈øtility again≈øt God, 'tis that which makes him thine enemy, and makes thee an enemy to him, As <hi>Jehu</hi> ≈øaid, <hi>What peace, ≈øo long as the whoredom of thy mother Jezabel and her witcherafts are ≈øo many?</hi> So what peace can there be, ≈øo long as thou do≈øt indulge thy ≈øelf in ≈øin, and make it thy bu≈øine≈øs to gratifie thy outward ≈øences, though it be to the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øure of God? 'Tis the greate≈øt mercy in the world to rob ≈øuch per≈øons of their peace, and to di≈øcover to them their danger; they are onely ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of true peace, by the knowledge of that which is fal≈øe. Therefore bring your ≈øelves to this tryal: whether or no doth that peace which now you plea≈øe your ≈øelves in, cau≈øe in you an eternal hatred of ≈øin? doth it ≈øet you at a di≈øtance from your mo≈øt beloved lu≈øts; then it is that peace that ≈øprings from God. The greate≈øt part of the world are in an e≈øtate of <hi>War</hi> with God, though they do not feel the effects of that war. True
<pb facs="tcp:62760:64"/>indeed, God doth not always draw the ≈øword, either of Famine, Pe≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or War, again≈øt a Nation, and yet they may be acting in a mo≈øt ho≈øtile way again≈øt God: So for a per≈øon, God may not bla≈øt thy e≈øtate, or ≈øend di≈øea≈øes upon thy per≈øon, or rai≈øe a tumult in thy con≈øcience, and make a con≈øpiracy of thy thoughts and pa≈ø≈øions again≈øt thy peace: thou may≈øt be quiet within, and yet have war with God; becau≈øe, as in the world there may be a Truce, when there is no peace, the War may ≈øtill continue, though there is a Truce between two Princes: or rather, there is not a Truce between God and the ≈øinner, but as a Town that is be≈øieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for many days, may not feel the Battery of their Enemy, becau≈øe he is undermining them to blow them up at once; ≈øo God doth not many times make his battery again≈øt ≈øinners, but he is under mining them, and the fall at the la≈øt will be dreadful, if there be not a compo≈øition.</p>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øe.</hi> 2. By way of exhortation; let me pre≈øs you all to follow peace, it is a duty which the Go≈øpel injoyns with the greate≈øt force of words and expre≈ø≈øions. The Apo≈øtle when he is to ≈øeal up his affection to them, he doth it with that prayer, 2 <hi>The≈ø≈ø.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Now the God of peace him≈øelf give you peace always, by all means:</hi> What ≈øtrange expre≈ø≈øions! Fir≈øt, he gives you; hear the Title of <hi>the God of peace,</hi> and then he ≈øaith [Him≈øelf] <hi>the God of peace him≈øelf.</hi> There's a great deal of force in that word; peace is ≈øo excellent a ble≈ø≈øing, and there is ≈øuch an abhorrency in our corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to it, that it is only the Lord him≈øelf that is able to effect it: As if the Apo≈øtle had ≈øaid, the Lord mu≈øt bow the heavens, he mu≈øt come down him≈øelf to create peace among you; and to expre≈øs the greater vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of his de≈øire, he ≈øaith, Give you peace always, by all means. So another Scripture, <hi>pur≈øue peace, follow peace with all men;</hi> a word that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports our pur≈øuit after it, though it runs from us. This is the ≈øtrain and tenour of the Go≈øpel, and this becomes you as Chri≈øtians. When Chri≈øt came to purcha≈øe our peace, he came as a Lamb, an innocent and meek Creature; Behold the Lamb of God. When the holy Spirit de≈øcended to ≈øeal the priviledge of peace to us, he de≈øcended in the form of a Dove; a Gaul-le≈øs creature, in whom there is no rancor nor bitterne≈øs. What a ≈øtrong engagement ≈øhould this be upon all of us to pur≈øue and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote peace? And for your encouragement con≈øider:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That in the times of the Go≈øpel, all the promi≈øes do as it were empty them≈øelves into this ble≈ø≈øing, the ble≈ø≈øing of peace. Thus <hi>I≈øai.</hi> 11.6. you ≈øhall find there a gracious promi≈øe re≈øpecting the times of the Go≈øpel. <hi>The Wolf al≈øo ≈øhall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard ≈øhall lie down with the Kid, and the Calf, and the young Lion, and the fatling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a little child ≈øhall lead them; and the Cow and the Bear ≈øhall
<pb facs="tcp:62760:65"/>≈øeed, their young ones ≈øhall lie down together, and the Lyon ≈øhall eat ≈øtraw like the Ox.</hi> That which I ob≈øerve from thence, is this, that God here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes to cau≈øe an univer≈øal peace and unity under the Go≈øpel, though it be as difficult as to per≈øwade the mo≈øt di≈øagreeing natures to a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able co-habition: For here the Scripture in≈øtances in tho≈øe creatures between which there is the mo≈øt natural, and therefore the mo≈øt fierce animo≈øities. The Lord will reconcile men, though their differences be never ≈øo great. What is too hard for the God of Peace to effect? Is not God of infinite power, of infinite love? then it ≈øhould quicken us to pur≈øue peace. 1. By prayer to him, becau≈øe he is able to effect it; certainly that God that was able to bring Order into the World, when it was a meer lump and ma≈øs of confu≈øion, is able to bring peace, and to unite our ≈øpirits.</p>
            <p>And it is ob≈øervable, the greater our differences and divi≈øions are, the more will the power of this God appear in reconciling them. 'Tis ≈øaid in the <hi>P≈øalms,</hi> that <hi>Gods throne is in darkne≈øs;</hi> that is, his ways of Providence are very difficult for us to trace and find out; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when our divi≈øions are at the highe≈øt, he is able by one word to allay the ≈øtorm. This ≈øhould encourage us in Prayer. This is the cour≈øe of God to glorifie him≈øelf, by putting a ≈øtop to the greate≈øt troubles when neare≈øt to us, and to work out one contrary by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. To give you ≈øome in≈øtances, that ≈øo we may encourage our Faith, and quicken our Prayer to God for this ble≈ø≈øing, con≈øider how ≈øtill God hath made <hi>difficulties the way for enjoyment:</hi> For in≈øtance, the promi≈øe that <hi>Sarah</hi> ≈øhould be the Mother of a child; but he made way for that by her dead Womb, for all that numerous Progeny which like the Stars of the Skie de≈øcended from her. That he fir≈øt maimed <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and then gave him the ble≈ø≈øing. He brought <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi> from the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon to a Princely Palace. Fir≈øt <hi>David</hi> was hara≈ø≈øed with troubles, and then his head was deckt with the Imperial Crown. So if you look into the Kingdom of Chri≈øt, who would have thought that a few <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhermen-men</hi> ≈øhould have advanced the Empire of Chri≈øt in the World? Had you lived to have ≈øeen tho≈øe de≈øpicable beginnings, when a few unlearned men were the Heraulds and Preachers of Chri≈øt, how would this have cau≈øed you to fail and ≈øink in your ≈øpirits! and yet the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpel hath been Preached in all parts of the World, and that by a few Fi≈øher-men. The Providences of God are like tho≈øe plated Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, if you look one way upon them, there is the appearance of a Serpent; if you look on the other ≈øide, there is the appearance of an Angel. So here, many times God is plea≈øed to ≈øuffer exa≈øperations
<pb facs="tcp:62760:65"/>to go very high, that ≈øo his power may appear more eminent in the compo≈øure of them. He it is that enables the faith of his people to draw Water out of the Rock, when the Fountain is dry; that makes meat to come out of the Eater (as in <hi>Samp≈øon</hi>'s Riddle) that is able to bring a peaceable harmony out of devouring differences; and therefore it ≈øhould quicken our prayers to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To make us more ≈øerious in our endeavours after peace. Con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what a di≈øhonour it is to the Go≈øpel, that tho≈øe that profe≈øs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves Sons of the ≈øame God, Members of the ≈øame Chri≈øt, Temples of the ≈øame Spirit, ≈øhould be at deadly jarrs one with another; It is ≈øtrange and unnatural that <hi>Lillies</hi> ≈øhould prove <hi>Thorns</hi> to one another; that tho≈øe who are Saints in pretence, ≈øhould be Devils in practice to one another; that Gods Diamonds ≈øhould cut one another; this is very ≈øtrange; yet thus it is. But now e≈øpecially it is mo≈øt ≈øad, when Religion which ≈øhould re≈øtrain and bridle our pa≈ø≈øions, is made fuel and incentives of them: How farre di≈øtant is it from the coun≈øel of the Apo≈øtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.10. where he ≈øpeaks concerning their le≈ø≈øer differences, <hi>one values one day above another, another e≈øteems every day alike?</hi> what's His coun≈øel? he ≈øpeaks as a per≈øon that was fill'd with bowels and compa≈ø≈øion: Oh, ≈øaith he, let not him that doth not e≈øteem the day, judge him that doth: <hi>For we ≈øhall all ≈øtand before the judgement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeat of Chri≈øt,</hi> there we ≈øhall appear all upon a level, ≈øtand upon equal ground, and receive our final doom from him: This therefore ≈øhould calm our Spirit. Why may there not be ≈øome differences in judgement, without divi≈øion in <hi>affection?</hi> for it is as impo≈ø≈øible that all judgements ≈øhould be of the ≈øame extent, as all our faces to be of the ≈øame colour and figure. Therefore con≈øider what an injury it is to our Profe≈ø≈øion, how doth it ob≈øcure the glory of God, and lu≈øtre of our Religion?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Doth not the <hi>publick enemy</hi> rejoyce over us, I mean the <hi>Papi≈øts?</hi> do they not warm them≈øelves at the ≈øparks of our Divi≈øions? For you know the old Maxim of <hi>Divide and Reign:</hi> therefore it ≈øhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe our ≈øpirits, and quicken us to labour after union. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nmortified lu≈øts</hi> are thence, whence all Wars and Enmities ≈øprings in the World. The Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul</hi> when he would compo≈øe their differences, he doth not lay, down Rules to decide their controver≈øies, but to correct their ≈øecret pa≈ø≈øions, pride, ≈øelf-≈øeeking, revenge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This being the ≈øeed of all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øturbances in the Church: And although the≈øe Lu≈øts may not be con≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous and vi≈øible to the eyes of men, yet they are certainly the fuel of our di≈øtempers.</p>
            <p>The ≈øum of all is this, tho≈øe that have the Spirit of God, they cannot
<pb facs="tcp:62760:66"/>but mourn and be ≈øen≈øible of the≈øe divi≈øions, I know a great part among us are unconcerned: ≈øome rejoyce, tho≈øe that are rather buried in the affairs of the World, and incumbred with much bu≈øine≈øs, or tho≈øe that are ≈øteeped in the plea≈øures of ≈øen≈øe, are altogether unaffected with the≈øe things, ≈øtand as <hi>Newters,</hi> di≈øregarding all events: But the Saints of God cannot but mourn over them, when our divi≈øions hinder the progre≈øs of the Go≈øpel, &amp; are ≈øerviceable to nothing but to the Kingdom of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs. Therefore I be≈øeech you, let what hath been ≈øpoken quicken you in your prayers to God, to <hi>pray for the peace of Jecu≈øalem,</hi> (that's the lea≈øt effect of our love and de≈øires after peace) and by all endeavours to labour to bring back peace to us, that we may ≈øee that prophe≈øie fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in our time, that <hi>the Lord ≈øhould be one, and his Name one among≈øt us.</hi>

Chri≈øt when he died, he looked upon God as an Enemy, as a Judge; and as tho≈øe colours which we ≈øee conveyed to us, are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwerable to the Medium through which we ≈øee them; as, if we look through a coloured gla≈øs, we ≈øee the object of that colour: So the Lord Je≈øus, when he was upon the Cro≈øs, looked upon God through the black-cloud of our ≈øins, and through the red cloud of his Fathers wrath, and ≈øo dyed as a Sacrifice to Divine Ju≈øtice. But when he was rai≈øed from the Grave, that was the te≈øtimony of Gods love to him, and of his love to us; for he died as our <hi>Surety,</hi> he was arre≈øted for our <hi>Debt,</hi> he was ca≈øt into
<pb facs="tcp:62760:66"/>the <hi>Grave,</hi> as into a <hi>Pri≈øon:</hi> But by his <hi>Re≈øurrection</hi> he was redeemed from Pri≈øon and Judgement. And therefore you ≈øhall find, when Chri≈øt was: ri≈øen, he ≈øalutes his Di≈øciples with this, <hi>Peace be unto you,</hi> Luk. 24.31. There was the dawning of peace at the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of Chri≈øt, for then the Angels ≈øung, <hi>Peace upon earth;</hi> but the compleat Sun-≈øhine of peace was at his <hi>Re≈øurrection,</hi> when he had made full and compleat ≈øatisfaction to Gods Ju≈øtice: for this was a clearing of him before all the World, when God rai≈øed him from the Grave. And in this re≈øpect it was very agreeable for the Apo≈øtle to ≈øay, <hi>The God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Je≈øus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It was the eflect of <hi>Infinite power.</hi> You know it is naturally impo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible for a dead body to quicken him≈øelf, to revive; but for the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus, who had the load of the ≈øins of all the Elect upon him, who was, as it were ≈øecured in the Grave by Gods Ju≈øtice and Power, for him to ri≈øe again: This mu≈øt be an effect of <hi>In≈øinite Power</hi> in the Great God. Thus rai≈øing of Chri≈øt, ≈øometimes 'tis attributed to the <hi>Son,</hi> being God equal with the Father: But here 'tis attributed to God: and therefore when the Scripture would ≈øpeak with the greate≈øt magnificence of the <hi>Power of God,</hi> it expre≈ø≈øes it thus, <hi>That power which rai≈øed Je≈øus Chri≈øt from the dead.</hi> When Chri≈øt wrought deliverance for the lo≈øt world, (all tho≈øe who were commited to his charge.) This could be no le≈øs then the work of an infinite Power. And upon this account al≈øo it is very proportionable to the de≈øign of the Apo≈øtle, for that prayer he makes to God is for that which onely can be accompli≈øhed by <hi>Infinite Love,</hi> and <hi>Infinite Power, i.e.</hi> to make the Chri≈øtian <hi>Hebrews perfect in every good work to do his will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come to a further de≈øcription. <hi>He that brought again from the dead [our Lord Je≈øus.]</hi> the Title of the <hi>Lord Je≈øus</hi> was onely given to our Saviour after his <hi>Re≈øurrection,</hi> he was called <hi>Lord</hi> before, and <hi>Je≈øus</hi> before: but the≈øe two Titles were ever united till after his Re≈øurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>hey came to ≈øee the place where the body of the Lord Je≈øus lay;</hi> the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon was this, becau≈øe the Re≈øurrection of Chri≈øt was a ≈øolemn Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to the World, that Chri≈øt was the Son of God. 'Tis true, this Title was given him immediately upon his conception, but it was never compleatly declared to the World, till after his Re≈øurrection; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Chri≈øt was a Prince in di≈øgui≈øe; the beams of the Divinity was abated by the vail of his Humanity; but then he was declared by pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be the Son of God.</p>
            <p>It followes <hi>[That great Shepherd of the Sheep]</hi> for the opening of this;</p>
            <p n="1">1. We will con≈øider this Title of Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Per≈øon for whom this Title relates.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:67"/>Fir≈øt, This Title <hi>[The great Shepherd]</hi> 'Tis a wonderful conde≈øcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Chri≈øt, that he will take upon him the Title of a Shepherd, that which rather expre≈ø≈øes Love and Care, than Power and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet he is plea≈øed to a≈ø≈øume this Title to expre≈øs his affection to us. For the opening of it, wherein he appears to be the great Shepherd, I ≈øhall lay down the≈øe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He is great in the Dignity of his Per≈øon; for, he that is Lord of Angels, is become the Shepherd of the Sheep; and the humiliation of his per≈øon in this re≈øpect, is the exaltation of his Office: It is look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon in the World as a mean and low employment, to have the care and in≈øpection of a Flock; but now herein appears the love of Chri≈øt, he was plea≈øed to become our Shepherd, that ≈øo he might ≈øecure and bring us to the Fold of Heaven, and there make us to feed upon tho≈øe Pa≈øtures, and to drink of tho≈øe Rivers of plea≈øures which flow from the pre≈øence of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the derivation of his Authority: That Authority which is communicated to him, whereby he is our Shepherd: and that is ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally from God him≈øelf; It is not by any mediate deputation, but from God him≈øelf. He is our Shepherd, and hath a Title to his Flock upon a double account.

This is ≈øtrange, that Chri≈øt ≈øhould be <hi>a ≈øheep for the ≈ølaughter,</hi> that he might become our Shepherd, that he ≈øhould be a ≈øacrifice before he could take his Office upon him: Other ≈øheep lay down their lives for the Shepherd, but Chri≈øt laid down his life for the Sheep. So great was his love, that it brought him from Heaven to <hi>≈øeek and find tho≈øe that were lo≈øt;</hi> he left a <hi>Palace</hi> to come to a <hi>Wilderne≈øs;</hi> a Throne of Heaven to come to a Fold here upon Earth.

            <p>The ≈øecond Argument is this, That he hath de≈øign'd Chri≈øt to be the Shepherd of the Church, <hi>The great Shepherd of the Sheep;</hi> this is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther argument and evidence that he is reconciled to us, and that he is the <hi>God of Peace:</hi> For when God gave Chri≈øt to be our Sacrifice, and rai≈øed him up to be our Shepherd; the≈øe are the mo≈øt clear Te≈øtimonies of his Love: For, although Chri≈øt now ≈øits in Heaven, and <hi>all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God wor≈øhip him,</hi> yet he doth not di≈ødain to exerci≈øe the ≈øame care, and to expre≈øs the ≈øame Love to his People, that he did when he was upon the Earth.

This doth expre≈øs the effects of his two Natures in this Title; and therefore an admirable evidence that God is at peace with us.</p>
            <p>It follows, <hi>[Through the bloud of the everla≈øting Covenant.]</hi> The bloud of Chri≈øt is that which cements God and us together: For you mu≈øt remember, our <hi>original peace</hi> with God was broken; that peace we have with him now, is called <hi>Reconciliation;</hi> it is as a broken bone, which well ≈øet, is ≈øtronger then before, becau≈øe Nature conveys mo≈øt liberal ≈øupplies to the weake≈øt part: ≈øo now being reconciled to God, through the bloud of his Son, we ≈øtand upon ≈øurer terms with him, than we did in Innocency; The <hi>Bloud of Chri≈øt</hi> ≈øpeaks better things for us, than all our <hi>Sins</hi> ≈øpeak again≈øt us; it ≈øpeaks peace to our ≈øouls, &amp; that in Heaven pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha≈øed by his death. Chri≈øt died as a <hi>Te≈øtator,</hi> and bequeathed to the Church a <hi>Legacy of Peace;</hi> he lives as the <hi>Executor</hi> of that Covenant, and now in Heaven conveys to us that ble≈ø≈øing of Peace, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath'd in his death. And as our Peace was founded in his <hi>Bloud,</hi> ≈øo it is con≈øerv'd by his <hi>Interce≈ø≈øion;</hi> he appears in the Court of Heaven as our Emba≈ø≈øadour, to make up all tho≈øe differences which fall out between God and us; for you know, Amity and Friend≈øhip is kept between For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign <hi>States,</hi> by their Re≈øidents and Agents, that are kept in their ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Courts; ≈øo we have an <hi>Agent</hi> in the Court of Heaven, the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt, that was rai≈øed from the dead: And as a Believer falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ≈øin, which is a breach of Peace between God and us, ≈øo that Peace is made up by the exerci≈øe of repentance on our part, and by ≈øprinkling of Chri≈øts bloud upon us, on Gods part. The renewed exerci≈øe of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and application of Chri≈øts bloud, pre≈øeryes that peace that is
<pb facs="tcp:62760:69"/>between God and Believers. And (to ≈øum up the force of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument) when we had fallen from God, and it did not con≈øi≈øt with the Maje≈øty of God to make peace with us, without ≈øatisfaction, then was he plea≈øed to pay our Ran≈øom out of his own Trea≈øury, and Redeem us by the bloud of his Sonne; So that all his Attributes might ≈øhine forth in their Lu≈øtre, and glory in our Salvation, and that upon ≈øure terms we might be able to challenge an Intere≈øt in his Favour and Love.</p>
            <p>It follows, <hi>Through the bloud of the [Everla≈øting Covenant.]</hi> It is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an <hi>Everla≈øting Covenant</hi> in two re≈øpects.</p>

            <p>I have now gone over the Title, and that in order to the Prayer which follows, <hi>[Make you perfect to do his will, working in you that which is well-plea≈øing in his ≈øight,]</hi> the general ≈øum of it is this: That God of Peace who is reconciled to us in his Son, as he is the <hi>Father of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> to us, ≈øo he is the <hi>Fountain of Holine≈øs</hi> to us; and in this re≈øpect we can onely expect from him <hi>the trea≈øures of Grace,</hi> as he is the <hi>God of Peace;</hi> for God, as he is our Judge, di≈øpences to Sinners nothing
<pb facs="tcp:62760:70"/>but revenge; there is nothing to be expected but the cur≈øe of his Law, the Execution of that ≈øentence of death from him. For, although the World de≈øpi≈øe holine≈øs as a ba≈øe and contemptible thing, they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be <hi>ungracious,</hi> than <hi>inglorious</hi> in the eyes of men, and upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they are afraid to be <hi>Holy,</hi> le≈øt they ≈øhould be the publick ≈øcorn and contempt of the place wherein they live: although holine≈øs is of ≈øo low a price in the world, yet in Heaven, next to God, Chri≈øt, and the Spirit, Holine≈øs is the mo≈øt rich Jewel, <hi>that</hi> God can be≈øtow upon us; and therefore we mu≈øt fir≈øt look upon him as the <hi>God of Peace,</hi> before we can beg any grace from him. And this is the Rea≈øon why the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle repre≈øents God by the≈øe Titles, that he might encourage the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> to believe God would grant this reque≈øt. When Chri≈øt dyed for us, it was not his de≈øign only to quiet our con≈øciences, but to quicken our ≈øouls, not onely to free us from Damnation, but from the <hi>Domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ≈øin:</hi> And therefore you ≈øhall find the≈øe two are joyned together, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14 <hi>Who gave him≈øelf for us that he might Redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto him≈øelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi> The death of Chri≈øt, as there was a <hi>value</hi> in it to purcha≈øe Gods favour, ≈øo there was a <hi>vertue</hi> in it to re≈øtore to us Gods Image. And the account of his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us is it, that we mu≈øt expect the lea≈øt degree of Grace and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line≈øs from God. And this is the rea≈øon why the Apo≈øtle prefaces this, <hi>Now the God of Peace,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I know you expect I ≈øhould ≈øay ≈øomething as to my non-conformity, I ≈øhall onely ≈øay thus much, It is neither fancy, faction, nor humour, that makes me not to comply, but meerly for fear of offending God. And if after the be≈øt means u≈øed for my illumination; as prayer to God, di≈øcour≈øe, ≈øtudy, I am not able to be ≈øatisfied concerning the lawfulne≈øs of what is required; if it be my unhappine≈øs to be in error, ≈øurely <hi>men</hi> wil have no rea≈øon to be angry with me in this world, and I hope <hi>God</hi> will pardon me in the next.</p>

               <q>A New Commandment give I unto you, that ye love one another, as I have loved you.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>VVE are this day called to a Love-fea≈øt; and nothing can be more ≈øuitable than to treat of Chri≈øtian Love; Je≈øus Chri≈øt hath given us a great evidence of his Love to us, he bled Love at every vein; therefore we are to imitate him, and as becometh Chri≈øtians, to Love one another. 'Tis a general complaint, how true I know not, <hi>That this is the great Grace that is defective among Chri≈øtians.</hi> Although they pretend much Love to Chri≈øt, yet they have little Love one to another.</p>
            <p>I have in former Sermons di≈øcour≈øed concerning Faith, how that by Faith we mu≈øt receive Chri≈øt in the Sacrament; and now I ≈øhall ≈øpeak ≈øomething of Love; Love is needful at a fea≈øt, it is requi≈øite when we ≈øit down at our own Table. I remember it is ≈øaid of <hi>Augu≈øtin, He would not ≈øuffer any to fea≈øt at his Table that came in a Spirit of Rancor, and ≈øate down in pa≈ø≈øion.</hi> Sure I am, they are not fit to be Gue≈øts at Chri≈øts Table, that come not in a Spirit of Meekne≈øs and Love. It is true, we are to eat the Pa≈ø≈øover with bitter herbs, but they mu≈øt be the bitter Herbs of Repentance, not the bitter Herbs of Malice, Wrath, and Fury; we mu≈øt come here with bitter Tears, not with bitter Hearts: hear what the Text ≈øaith, <hi>A New Command I give unto you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Wherein, Fir≈øt, you have the Command, <hi>A New Command I give unto you;</hi> It is not left to our di≈øcretion, but, we are bound to it by vertue of a Command, <hi>A New Command I give unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, This Command is enforced by Gods own example, <hi>as I have loved you.</hi> It is called a new Command, but Love is an old Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, this Law is written in the Nature of Man. It is engraven in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans heart by Nature, and it is an old Command, becau≈øe found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Gods antient Statutes, the antient Records of his Law; I, but
<pb facs="tcp:62760:71"/>'tis a new Command too, becau≈øe pre≈ø≈øed by a new Example of Chri≈øt, <hi>As I have loved you, ≈øo do ye love one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>Chri≈øtians ought to make Con≈øcience of this duty of</hi> loving one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. <hi>Confident I am, We ≈øhall never ≈øee Religion thrive in the World, until we ≈øee this Grace of Love flouri≈øh in the heart of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor the illu≈øtration of this propo≈øition, I ≈øhall do the≈øe two things;
<list>
                  <item>Fir≈øt, ≈øhew you the truth of this Love:</item>
                  <item>Secondly, the extent of this Love.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Truth of this Love; If you love one another, ≈øaith Chri≈øt, ≈øee you do it purely, not di≈ø≈øembling, but from the heart. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.18. <hi>My little Children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth;</hi> di≈ø≈øembling love is like painted fire that will never warm; we mu≈øt not be like the Bee, that hath honey in her mouth, but withal hath a ≈øting in her tail; we mu≈øt not pretend to love, to have honey in the mouth, but withal have the ≈øting of malice in the heart; no, ≈øaid the Apo≈øtle, <hi>Let us love in deed and in truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Extent of our Love; this Fountain of Love mu≈øt run in three ≈øtreams.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We mu≈øt love all men, love their per≈øons, although we mu≈øt not love their ≈øins, we have all the ≈øame make, the ≈øame lump and mould, and therefore mu≈øt love; there is a natural Love, that every creature bears to his own ≈øpecies and kind.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our love mu≈øt e≈øpecially ≈øtream out to the Saints of God the hou≈øhold of Faith. It is with our love, as it is with our fire, you keep fire all the day upon the Hearth, but upon ≈øpecial occa≈øions you draw it out larger, ≈øo our Love mu≈øt always burn to all: I but to the Saints you mu≈øt draw out the fire, inlarge your affections, we mu≈øt love as God loves, he doth e≈øpecially love the Saints: love every creature with a common love, but e≈øpecially the New Creature; and indeed there is that in every true Saint, that may excite and allure our Love. What are the Graces of the Spirit, but ≈øo many pearls to adorn the Bride of Chri≈øt? What is holine≈øs in the heart, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> the imbroidery and curious Workman≈øhip of the Holy Gho≈øt? here is enough to entice and draw out our Love: and Beloved, if we love the Saints for their Graces, then we love all the Saints.</p>
            <p>And here I be≈øeech you con≈øider the≈øe ≈øix pariculars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> We ought to love the Saints in what condition ≈øoever they are, although they be poor in the world, low in their condition, for commonly ≈øo it is. They that have the lowe≈øt hearts, have the lowe≈øt
<pb facs="tcp:62760:71"/>condition too. I read of the King of the Moors, that he was offended at the Chri≈øtians becau≈øe of their poverty: and truly when wicked men do fleece the Saints, it is no wonder if they be poor: methinks grace in a poor man, is like a Pearl that lies in the du≈øt, or like a cloath of Gold that is hid under Rags; you mu≈øt love the Gold, that is, the Grace, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding the Rags. The poore≈øt Saint alive hath the Angels riches; the poore≈øt Believer is a Member of Chri≈øt, and ≈øhall we not love him? we love the picture of a friend although it be hung in a mean frame: we mu≈øt love a rich Chri≈øt in a poor man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are to love the people of God although they have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny weak infirmities: ≈øhew me the man that is perfect, and let him throw the fir≈øt ≈øtone, even the be≈øt. Saints like the Starrs they have their twinkling, they have their blemi≈øhes and their failings: in ≈øome there's too much pride, in others too much cen≈øoriou≈øne≈øs, in others too much ra≈øh anger and pa≈ø≈øion, but we mu≈øt love the Grace that is in them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding the infirmities that are in them: you love Gold though in the oar, and mixed with much impurity; a Saint on earth, is like a Diamond that hath its flaw, like to the Ro≈øe that is ≈øweet and perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but yet hath its pricks. The be≈øt Saints have ≈øome mixture and infirmity, and we mu≈øt love them for the good that is in them: this is our great fault, we are apt to over-look all the good, and ≈øo take notice of the ≈øtain and blemi≈øhes in them; as tho≈øe that ≈øee a little ≈øtain in a piece of Scarlet, de≈øpi≈øe the cloath for the ≈øtains ≈øake; ≈øo do we. But God doth not do ≈øo by us, he is plea≈øed to over-look many ≈øad failings, he ≈øeeth the Faith, and winks at the failings of his people; you that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love a Brother becau≈øe you ≈øee an imperfection in him, would you have God do ≈øo by you, would you have him damn you for every ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øh of ≈øin?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We mu≈øt love the Children of God, though weak in parts; all are not born Politicians; But though the Saints of God have not always ≈øo good intellectuals as others, yet if they have good Vitals, and the life of Faith in them, love them for that Grace; you do not de≈øpi≈øe your Children becau≈øe they are weak, but you love them becau≈øe they are your Children. Oh! do not de≈øpi≈øe a Saint becau≈øe he is of low parts, but love him as he is a Child of your Heavenly Fathers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We are to love the Saints of God though in ≈øome le≈ø≈øer things they differ from us, if they keep the foundations of Religion, and hold the Head, Chri≈øt; yet we are to bear other things: one Chri≈øtian hath more light than another, and ≈øhall we un-≈øaint all that cannot come up to our light? Its great wi≈ødom to ≈øeparate between the precious
<pb facs="tcp:62760:72"/>and the vile: O what a ble≈ø≈øed place will Heaven be, becau≈øe there our light ≈øhall be clear, and our love ≈øhall be perfect. And that is the fourth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Love the Saints of God when reviled and per≈øecuted; a bleeding Saint ≈øhould be the object of our love. <hi>Oni≈øiphorus,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>Paul, was not a≈øhamed of my chain;</hi> a ≈øign he loved Chri≈øts Graces in <hi>Paul.</hi> Chri≈øt Je≈øus loveth no Saints more than his per≈øecuted Saints, his Martyrs have the highe≈øt Thrones re≈øerved in Heaven for them: we mu≈øt love to ≈øee Chri≈øts Livery upon a man, though ≈øprinkled with bloud: he that is a≈øhamed of a per≈øecuted Saint, will never ≈øuffer for a crucified Je≈øus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> We mu≈øt love the Saints of God, though their Graces may eclip≈øe and out-≈øhine our Graces. Beloved, in the ≈øweete≈øt fruits worms are apt to breed, and in the be≈øt heart, the worm of pride is apt to be breeding; if God doth not keep us, we ≈øhall not onely envy anothers Graces, if they out-≈øhine us, but their per≈øons too. What though ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Graces do out-≈øhine yours? yet love him, becau≈øe the eminency of his Graces bringeth much honor to the Go≈øpel of our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>And thus my Beloved, I have ≈øhewn you how you mu≈øt love all the Saints, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Love the Brother-hood, love the whole Fraternity of Beleevers.</hi> Oh! that this ≈øweet ≈øpice of love might ≈øend forth its perfume among Chri≈øtians, that we could turn all our heart-burnings into heart-breakings, and quench the fire of Divi≈øions and Contentions, and keep the fire of love burning upon the Altar of our hearts. And my Beloved, as we mu≈øt love all the Saints, ≈øo we mu≈øt ≈øhew this love by the fruit of it, for God doth not value that love that is invi≈øible; the fruits of our love to the Saints mu≈øt be the≈øe four.</p>
            <list>
               <head>Four Fruits of Love to the Saints.</head>
               <item>1. We mu≈øt ≈øhew love to them by pri≈øing their per≈øons above others, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 15.4. ≈øpoken of a man that ≈øhall go to Heaven, <hi>In who≈øe eyes a vile per≈øon is contemned, but he honoureth them that fear the Lord:</hi> the wicked are ≈øo much rubbi≈øh and lumber, but the Saints are called the Jewels, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. and we mu≈øt prize the≈øe Jewels above all the Lumber in the World; as they ≈øaid of King <hi>David, thy life is worth ten thou≈øand of ours,</hi> 2 Sam. 18.3. ≈øo is a Godly man above a wicked man; God he will give Kingdons to ran≈øom his Saints, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 43.3. <hi>I gave</hi> Egypt <hi>for thy ran≈øom,</hi> Aethiopia <hi>and</hi> Sheba <hi>for thee:</hi> and thus ≈øhould we ≈øet the highe≈øt rate upon the Saints of God, for that is to love them.</item>
               <item>2. We mu≈øt ≈øhew love to all the Saints of God, by vindicating of them, when they are traduced and ≈ølandered; its a great ≈øin to ≈ølander
<pb facs="tcp:62760:72"/>a Chri≈øtian, its to go to pollute Chri≈øts Image, the wicked their throats are open Sepulchres, to bury the names of the Righteous in; now you that are Chri≈øtians mu≈øt not be ready to receive a fal≈øe and groundle≈øs report of a Saint, but rather vindicate them, for that is to love them.</item>
               <item>2. We ≈øhew our love to the Saints, by praying for them; you know not what good your prayers may do them: Mini≈øters mu≈øt pray for their People, and the People mu≈øt pray for their Mini≈øters; for prayer commands God him≈øelf, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 45.11. Prayer is the golden Key that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks the Heavenly trea≈øure of Gods bowels. <hi>Oh pray one for another;</hi> we ≈øhould not ≈øtrive one with another (as is too frequent) but pray one for another.</item>
               <item>4. Shew your love by being ready according to your abilities to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their wants; to love one another is to be a well-wi≈øher to him, and to do all the friendly Offices we can one for another; there are, my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, many of the dear Servants of God in the Mini≈øtry, that have been already reduced to mi≈øery and want, and abundance more are like to be reduced to great nece≈ø≈øities; Now I be≈øeech you to ≈øhow your love to the hou≈øhold of Faith, for that is a ≈øign of your true love to God, and to the Brother-hood, that when as myrrh drops freely from the Tree, ≈øo works of mercy drops freely from the heart. If Je≈øus Chri≈øt ≈øhould ≈øtand in the mid≈øt of the congregation, and ≈øay, <hi>≈øhew your Love to me by your good works;</hi> I believe no heart here would be ≈øo hard as to deny Je≈øus Chri≈øt; Why, remember what≈øoever you give Mini≈øters, and to his Members, he takes it as given to him≈øelf.</item>
            </list>
            <p>That is the ≈øecond, <hi>Our Love mu≈øt extend to all Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Our Love mu≈øt reach to our enemies, we mu≈øt love them that do not love us, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.1. <hi>Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you.</hi> I confe≈ø≈øe, a mortal enemy, I would be loath to make a bo≈øom friend. But though policy teach us not to tru≈øt our enemies, yet piety teacheth us to love them: Chri≈øt, he did pray for his enemies, and he ≈øhed tears of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øion for them that afterwards ≈øhed his bloud. So much for the Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal part. Now for a word of Application, and I have done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>SES.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And fir≈øt, this may ≈øerve to reprove tho≈øe, who ≈øeem in other things to be excellent, and profe≈øs much love toward Chri≈øt and his Go≈øpel, but have no love to the Saints of God: there are ≈øome that upon this very account, have for the≈øe great many years ab≈øented them≈øelves from the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> becau≈øe they pretend not to be in charity. This is a double-dyed ≈øin, a ≈øin with a witne≈øs; its a ≈øin not to come, and its a ≈øin not to be in charity. But let me ≈øay this to them, ≈øurely ≈øuch kind
<pb facs="tcp:62760:73"/>of <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> are a ≈øhame to their profe≈ø≈øion. What, doth not the Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel teach you charity and love, as well as faith? Surely that <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> hath no grace in his heart, that liveth out of charity with his Brother; for as the Philo≈øopher ≈øaith, <hi>All the vertues are linked together, and tyed as with a≈øtring, and where there is one, there is all: and where one is wanting, there is no vertue:</hi> ≈øo I ≈øay of the graces, they are linked together, and where there is one, there is all: and where one is wanting, there is none at all. Saith <hi>Augu≈øtine, Thou bragge≈øt of thy faith in Chri≈øt, but ≈øhew me thy faith by thy love to Chri≈øt, for Faith and love cannot be ≈øeparated:</hi> For as in the Sun, there is light and heat, and the≈øe cannot be ≈øeparated one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ≈øo faith and love is twi≈øted together, and where there is one wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the other is wanting: as he that did ≈øo engrave his name on the Buckler of <hi>Minerva,</hi> that who ever went about to take out his name, ≈øpoiled the Buckler: ≈øo Faith and love are ≈øo in≈øeparable, that if you go to take away the one, you ≈øpoyl the other. Oh! remember and mourn for it, thou that ≈øaye≈øt thou art not in charity: it's a ≈øad ≈øymptom thou art not in a ≈øtate of Grace, <hi>Titus</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>For me our ≈øelves al≈øo were ≈øometimes fooli≈øh, di≈øobedient, deceived, ≈øerving divers Lu≈øts and plea≈øures, living in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, envy, hateful, and hating one another,</hi> that is, before conver≈øion we were ≈øwelled with poy≈øon of malice and wrath; but when once the grace of God came, then it was otherwi≈øe; that man that hath not Love and Charity in his heart, ≈øurely he hath nothing of God in him, for God is Love; he knoweth nothing of the Go≈øpel ≈øavingly, for the Go≈øpel is a Go≈øpel of peace; he hath none of the wi≈ødom which cometh from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for that is meek and gentle, and ea≈øie to be entreated.</p>
            <p>If there be any on the other ≈øide, that are not in charity, and yet will come to the Lords Table, remember this, you get no good by the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, you do but defile the Ordinance. The Apo≈øtle calls it, the <hi>leaven of malice;</hi> it doth ≈øower all your Holy Duties, Sermons, Prayers, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; it is a little gall imbitters a great deal of honey: So where there is a little of this Gall of malice and hatred, it imbittereth and ≈øpoileth all the honey of your Graces and Duties. The Apo≈øtle bids us in prayer to lift up pure hands without wrath, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.2. <hi>I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up pure hands without wrath and doubting.</hi> What the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaketh of the duty of Prayer, I may ≈øay of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; when you come to ≈øee the Body and Blood of the Lord, Lift up pure hands without malice bitterne≈øs and wrath. That is a ≈øad ≈øpeech of <hi>Augu≈øtine, He that is full of rancor and malice, he is a man-≈ølayer:</hi> Nay: the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith it in the fir≈øt Epi≈øtle of <hi>John</hi> 3.15. <hi>Who≈øoever hateth his Brother is a murderer, and ye know no murderer hath Eternal life abiding in
<pb facs="tcp:62760:73"/>him;</hi> Do not think this Ordinance will profit you, if you do not come in love to the Saints; ≈øuppo≈øe a man drinketh down poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, and afterwards taketh down a Cordial, ≈øurely this Cordial will do him but little good; ≈øo thou that drinke≈øt down the poi≈øon of wrath and malice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> into thy ≈øoul, and come≈øt afterward to drink down the Cordial of Chri≈øts bloud in the Sacrament, why certainly this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial will do thee but little good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>EXHORTATION.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore to conclude by way of Exhortation; I be≈øeech you in the Lord, that you would remember this Text this day, when you come to the Lords Table, read over this Le≈ø≈øon, <hi>A new Commandment I give unto you, that you love one another as I have loved you;</hi> come to the Sacrament in love to Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and in love one to another, be not full of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, but full of bowels; the primitive Saints were of one heart; you all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect I know one Heaven, and will you not be of one heart? this I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is a great rea≈øon, why the Sacrament hath no more profited many receivers; you know if there be a ≈øtopping at the ≈øtomack, the meat ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in will never concoct and nouri≈øh; why thou that ha≈øt wrath and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and malice at thy heart, there is an ob≈øtruction as it were at the ≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and therefore it is that the bread of life doth not nouri≈øh thy Soul.

            <p>I ≈øhall only ≈øay this, we ≈øhould do all as the Serpent: <hi>Naturali≈øts</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve the Serpent, that before he goes to drink at the waters, he ca≈øts up his poi≈øon; ≈øo before you come to the Table of the Lords Supper, ca≈øt up your poi≈øon of bitterne≈øs, wrath, and malice, and then Chri≈øts bloud will be both a Medicine to heal you, and a Julip to refre≈øh you.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dearly Beloved,</hi> there are two things in every Mini≈øter of Chri≈øt that are much exerci≈øed; his Head, and his Heart; his Head with labour, and his Heart with Love; his Head with labour in the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtry; if done aright, it is a work fitter for Angels than for men; it is our work to open the Oracles of God, even tho≈øe ≈øacred profound things that the Angels ≈øearch into; and if God did not help us, we might ≈øoon ≈øink under the weight of ≈øuch a burden; and as a Mini≈øters head is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øed with labour, ≈øo his Heart is exerci≈øed with Love, and it is hard to ≈øay which of the two exceeds, his Labour or his Love: Thus is it here in the Text, <hi>My Dearly Beloved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the≈øe words we have St. <hi>Paul</hi> laying fiege to the≈øe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and labouring to make a happy victory, to conquer them with Kindne≈ø≈øe; <hi>Dearly Beloved,</hi> St. <hi>Pauls</hi> heart was the ≈øpring of Love, his lips were the Pipe, the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were the Ci≈øtern into which this ≈øpring did run: this Holy Apo≈øtle was a mirrour and a pattern of Love towards the ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Corinthians; Pauls</hi> tears did drop towards the praying <hi>Corinthians,</hi> his Love did burn; Holy <hi>Paul</hi> was a <hi>Seraphin,</hi> his Heart did burn in a flame of affection to his People: How many pa≈ø≈øages do we find ≈øcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in his Epi≈øtles? he tells his People, which ≈øometimes he did write to, and ≈øometimes he preached to, he looked after their ≈øouls more than their ≈øilver, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.14. <hi>We ≈øeek not yours, but you:</hi> as a tender Nur≈øe cheri≈øheth her child with the Bre≈øt, ≈øo St. <hi>Paul</hi> gave his People the brea≈øt-milk of the Word, in 1 <hi>The≈ø≈ø.</hi> 2.7. this man of God did not onely be≈øtow a Sermon upon his People, but was willing to impart his very ≈øoul to them if it might ≈øave theirs, 1 <hi>The≈ø≈ø.</hi> 2.8. <hi>We were willing to have imparted to you our own ≈øouls, becau≈øe you are dear unto us:</hi> Such was St. <hi>Pauls</hi> affection to his people, that without a complement he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them more than his life. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.17. <hi>and if I be offered upon the ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>ce and ≈øervice of your Faith, I rejoyce with you all;</hi> that is as if he had
<pb facs="tcp:62760:74"/>≈øaid, if it be ≈øo, that my bloud be poured forth as a ≈øacrifice, if my death may be any way ≈øerviceable unto you, if it may help forward the ≈øtrengthening and confirming of your Faith, I am willing to die, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce to do it: ≈øo full of affection was this Apo≈øtle, that he could not choo≈øe but love his people, though the more he did love, the le≈øs he ≈øhould be loved: In 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. Oh! how did <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øweeten all his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons with Love? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. if he reproved fin, yet he was angry in love, he dipt the Pill in Sugar, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.9, 10, 11. <hi>How turn ye again to weak and beggarly Elements? ye ob≈øerve days, and moneths, and years, I am afraid of you, le≈øt I have be≈øtowed on you labour in vain: Brethren, I be≈øeech you, be as I am.</hi> See how St. <hi>Paul</hi> chides their ≈øins, and yet at the ≈øame time courts their ≈øouls; no ≈øooner did he lanch the wound, but pre≈øently he poured in Wine and Oyl into it; ≈øo did <hi>Paul</hi> love his People, that he would not ju≈øtly give any offence to the weak Believer, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.13. <hi>If meat make my Brother to offend, I will never eat fle≈øh more while the world ≈øtandeth. Paul</hi> was like ≈øome tender Mother, who forbears to eat tho≈øe meats that ≈øhe might, for fear of hurting the child that ≈øhe gives ≈øuck to. Thus you ≈øee he was a ≈øpiritual Father made up of love; and ≈øurely my Brethren, this affection in ≈øome degree, is in all the true Mini≈øters of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, they are full of ≈øympathy and bowels unto tho≈øe over whom the Holy Gho≈øt hath made them Over≈øeers.</p>
            <p>I ≈øhall only glance at the Rea≈øon, why it will be thus, and why it ≈øhould be thus, that ≈øuch flaming affections there ≈øhould be in all Chri≈øts Mini≈øters to their People.</p>
            <p>It will be thus, for the≈øe two Rea≈øons briefly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> From that Principle within, that teacheth love; Grace doth not fire the heart with pa≈ø≈øion, but with compa≈ø≈øion; Grace in the heart of a Mini≈øter files off that ruggedne≈øs that is in his ≈øpirit; making him loving and courteous. <hi>Paul</hi> once breathed out per≈øecution, but when Grace came, this Bramble was turned into a ≈øpiritual Vine, twi≈øting him≈øelf about the ≈øouls of his People with loving embraces.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There will be this ardent love in a Mini≈øters heart, from the ≈øpiritual relation that is betwixt him and his People; he is a ≈øpiritual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ≈øhall we think him to be without bowels? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Though you have ten thou≈øand In≈øtructers, yet have ye not many Fathers; for in Chri≈øt Je≈øus I have begotten you through the Go≈øpel.</hi> Some he begets unto Chri≈øt, others he builds up in Chri≈øt. Doth not a Father provide cheerfully for his Children? Can a Father ≈øee bread taken from his Child, and not have his heart affected with it? Is it not a grief to a Parent to ≈øee his Child put out to a dry Nur≈øe?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:75"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There ≈øhould be this ardent love and affection in all Gods Mini≈øters, for this rea≈øon, becau≈øe this is the livelie≈øt way to do mo≈øt good; knotty and ≈øtubborn hearts will ≈øoone≈øt be wrought upon with kindne≈øs. The fire melteth the harde≈øt metal: the fire of love, with Gods ble≈ø≈øing, will melt the mo≈øt obdurate ≈øinner. A <hi>Boanerges,</hi> a Son of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolation; who comes in the ≈øpirit of Love, is the fitte≈øt to do a piece of Go≈øpel-chyrurgery, to re≈øtore and put ≈øuch a one in joynt again that is taken with a fault, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Re≈øtore ≈øuch a one with the ≈øpirit of Love and Meekne≈øs.</hi> Thus much in ≈øhort for the Doctrinal part.</p>
            <p>Give me leave now to make ≈øome Application.</p>
            <p>And fir≈øt, here are ≈øeveral Inferences that may be drawn from this: As</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> See here the right Character of a Go≈øpel-Mini≈øter: He is full of love, he exhorts, he comforts, he reproves, and all in love; he is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver angry with his People, but becau≈øe they will not be ≈øaved; how loath is a Mini≈øter of Chri≈øt to ≈øee precious Souls, like ≈øo many Jewels, ca≈øt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-board into the dead ≈øea of Hell; a con≈øcientious Mini≈øter would count it an unhappy gain, to gain the world, and lo≈øe the ≈øouls of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; he ≈øaith as the King of <hi>Sodom</hi> to <hi>Abraham, Give me the Per≈øons, and take thee the Goods,</hi> Gen. 14.21.</p>
            <p>The <hi>≈øecond</hi> branch of Information is this; are true Go≈øpel-Mini≈øters ≈øo full of Love? then how ≈øad is it to have ≈øuch Mini≈øters put upon a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as have no love to Souls? <hi>The work of the Mini≈øtry, it is a labour of Lope:</hi> Oh! how ≈øad it is to have ≈øuch in the Mini≈øtry, that can neither la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour nor love, that are ≈øuch as are without bowels, that look more at Tyths than at Souls, it mu≈øt needs be ≈øad with a people in any part of the world, to have ≈øuch Mini≈øters ≈øet over them, as either poi≈øons them with error, or do what in them lies to damn them by their wicked example: How can the Devil reprove ≈øin? How can the Mini≈øter cry out in the Pulpit again≈øt drunkenne≈ø≈øe, that will him≈øelf be drunk? <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.22. <hi>Thou that teache≈øt a man ≈øhould not ≈øteal, do≈øt thou ≈øteal? Thou that ≈øaye≈øt a man ought not to commit Adultery, do≈øt thou commit Adultery?</hi> We read that the Snuffers of the Tabernacle, were to be made of pure Gold, <hi>Exod.</hi> 37.23. tho≈øe who by their calling are to reprove and ≈ønuff off the ≈øins of others, they ≈øhould be pure Gold, holy per≈øons. In the Law, God did appoint the lip of the Leper ≈øhould be covered, he ought to have his lip covered, he ≈øhould not be permitted to ≈øpeak the Oracles of God, who though he be by Office an Angel, yet by life is a Leper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> See from hence the happine≈øs of a Mini≈øter, who is placed among ≈øuch a people as give him abundant cau≈øe of love; how happy is
<pb facs="tcp:62760:75"/>he that can ≈øay to his people from his heart, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>my dearly beloved:</hi> And here let me ≈øpeak by way of encouragement to you of this Pari≈øh; I find St. <hi>Paul</hi> commending the good he ≈øaw in his people, 1 <hi>The≈ø≈ø.</hi> 1.3. <hi>We are bound to thank God always for you Beloved, becau≈øe your Faith grows exceedingly.</hi> Here <hi>Paul</hi> is commending his People; in imitation of the Apo≈øtle, let me at this time ≈øpeak a commendatory word to you; I have exerci≈øed my Mini≈øtry now among you for almo≈øt ≈øixteen years, and I rejoyce and ble≈øs God that I cannot ≈øay, the more I love you, the le≈øs I am loved; I have received many ≈øignal demon≈øtrations of love from you, though other Pari≈øhes have exceeded you in number of hou≈øes, yet I think not for ≈øtrength of affection: I have with much comfort ob≈øerved your reverent attentions to the Word Preached; you rejoyced in this Light not for a ≈øea≈øon, but to this day: I have ob≈øerved your zeal again≈øt Errour: and as much as could be expected in a critical time, your unity and amity, this is your honour; and if for the future there ≈øhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny interruption made in my Mini≈øtry among you, though I ≈øhould not be permitted to preach to you, yet ≈øhall I not cea≈øe to love you, and to pray for you; but why ≈øhould there be any interruption made, where is the crime? ≈øome indeed ≈øay, that we are di≈øloyal and ≈øeditious; Beloved, what my actions and ≈øufferings for his Maje≈øty have been, is known not to a few of you: but however we mu≈øt go to Heaven through good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and through bad report, and it is well if we can get to glory, though we pa≈øs through the Pikes, I ≈øhall endeavour that I may ≈øtill approve the ≈øincerity of my Love to you; I will not promi≈øe that I ≈øhall ≈øtill preach among you, nor will I ≈øay that I ≈øhall not; I de≈øire to be guided by the ≈øil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thred of Gods Word and of Gods Providence, my heart is towards you: there is you know an expre≈ø≈øion in the late Act, that we ≈øhall be now ≈øhortly, as if we were naturally dead; and if I mu≈øt die, let me leave ≈øome Legacy with you before I go from you, I cannot but give you ≈øome coun≈øel and advice for your ≈øouls, and I hope there is no hurt in that: There are my beloved, the≈øe twenty Directions, that I de≈øire you to take ≈øpecial notice of, which I would leave as advice and coun≈øel with you about your Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> I be≈øeech you, keep your con≈øtant hours every day with God; the Godly man is a man ≈øet apart, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 4.3. not onely becau≈øe God hath ≈øet him apart by election, but becau≈øe he hath ≈øet him≈øelf apart by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; give God the <hi>Aurorae fitiam,</hi> begin the day with God, vi≈øit God in the morning before you make any other vi≈øit; wind up your hearts towards Heaven in the morning, and they will go the better all the day after: Oh! turn your Clo≈øets into Temples, read the Scriptures;
<pb facs="tcp:62760:76"/>the two <hi>Te≈øtaments</hi> are the two lips by which God ≈øpeaks to us; the≈øe will make you wi≈øe unto ≈øalvation: the Scripture is both a gla≈øs to ≈øhew you your ≈øpots, and a laver to wa≈øh them away; be≈øiege Heaven every day with prayer, thus per≈øume your hou≈øes, and keep a con≈øtant inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe with Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Get good Books into your hou≈øes, when you have not the Spring near to you, then get water into your Ci≈øterns: So when you have nor that whol≈øom Preaching that you de≈øire, good Books are Ci≈øterns that holds the waters of life in them to refre≈øh you. When <hi>Davids</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat was taken away, they covered him with warm cloaths. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. So when you find a chilne≈øs upon your ≈øouls, and that your former heat begins to abate, ply your ≈øelves with warm cloaths, get tho≈øe good Books that may acquaint you with ≈øuch truths as may warm and affect your hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Have a care of your Company, take heed of unnece≈ø≈øary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with ≈øinners, we cannot catch health from another, but we may ≈øoon catch a di≈øea≈øe; the di≈øea≈øe of ≈øin is very catching: I would be as fraid of coming among the wicked, as among tho≈øe that have the plague. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 106.35. <hi>They were mingled with the heathen, and learned their works:</hi> If we cannot make others better, let us have a care that they make not us wor≈øe: <hi>Lot</hi> was a miracle, he kept fre≈øh in <hi>Sodoms</hi> ≈øalt water. My be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, take heed of the occa≈øions of ≈øin, evil company is an occa≈øion of ≈øin. The <hi>Nazarites</hi> in the old Law, as they might drink no wine, ≈øo they were forbidden grapes, whereof the wine was made, as you read in <hi>Num.</hi> 6. to teach us, that all occa≈øions of ≈øin mu≈øt be avoided; evil company is <hi>belluo animatrum,</hi> the Devils draw-net, by which he draws millions to Hell: how many families, and how many ≈øouls have been ruined and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done in this City by evil company? many there are that go from a play-hou≈øe to a Whore-hou≈øe, and from a Tavern to <hi>Tyburn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Have a care whom you hear; it is our Saviour Chri≈øts coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.15. <hi>Beware of fal≈øe prophets that come to you in ≈øheeps cloathing, but inwardly are ravening wolves.</hi> Let me tell you, the Devil hath his Mini≈øters as well as Chri≈øt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.15. <hi>The Serpent ca≈øt out of his mouth water, as a flood over the woman;</hi> that is, as the Learned expound it, <hi>Satan</hi> by his Mini≈øters, and Emi≈ø≈øaries, ca≈øt out the floud of <hi>Arian</hi> Doctrine to drown the Church. There are ≈øome, who by the ≈øubtilty of their wit have learnt the Art to mix error with truth, and to give poi≈øon in a Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den cup. Take heed who you hear, and how you hear, be like tho≈øe Noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> that ≈øearched the Scriptures whether the things that they preached were ≈øo or not, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. Your ears mu≈øt not be like
<pb facs="tcp:62760:76"/>≈øpunges that ≈øuck in puddle-water as well as wine, but your ears mu≈øt be like a Fan, that fans out the chaff, but retains the pure Wheat; you mu≈øt be like tho≈øe in the Parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.48. that gathered the good Fi≈øh into ve≈ø≈øels, but ca≈øt the bad away; the Saints are called Virgins for their wi≈ødom: they will not let every one defile their Souls with error, they have a judicious ear, and a critical palate, that can di≈øtingui≈øh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween truth and error, and put a difference betwixt meat of Gods ≈øend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Devils Cooking.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Study ≈øincerity, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 51.6. <hi>Behold thou de≈øire≈øt truth in the inward part:</hi> Be what you ≈øeem to be, be not like Rowers in a Barge, that look one way and Row another: Do not look Heaven-ward by your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øion, and Row Hell-ward by your Conver≈øation; do not pretend to love God, and yet love ≈øin: <hi>≈øimulata Sanctitas, duplicata Iniquitas,</hi> counterfeit Piety is double Iniquity. Let your hearts be upright with God: the plainer the Diamond is, the richer it is; and the more plain the heart is, the more doth God value his Jewel; a little ru≈øty Gold is far better than a great deal of bright bra≈øs; a little true grace, though ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øted over with many infirmities, is better than all the gli≈øtering ≈øhews of Hypocrites; a ≈øincere heart is Gods current Coin, and he will give it grains of allowance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> As you love your ≈øouls be not ≈øtrangers to your ≈øelves, be much and often in the work of ≈øelf-examination; among≈øt all the books that you read, turn over the book of your own heart, look into the book of Con≈øcience, ≈øee what is written there, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 77.6. <hi>I commune with mine own heart:</hi> ≈øet up a judgement-≈øeat in your own ≈øouls, examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have grace or not, prove whether you are in the faith, be as much afraid of a painted holine≈øs, as you would be afraid of going to a painted heaven: do not think your ≈øelves good becau≈øe others think ≈øo: let the Word be the touch-≈øtone, by which you try your hearts: let the Word be the looking-gla≈øs, by which you judge of the complexion of your ≈øoul; for want of this ≈øelf-≈øearching, many live known to others, and die unknown to them≈øelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Keep your ≈øpiritual watch, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.37. <hi>What I ≈øay unto you, I ≈øay unto all, watch;</hi> if it were the la≈øt word I ≈øhould ≈øpeak, it ≈øhould be this word, <hi>Watch.</hi> Oh! what need hath a <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> to be ever upon his Watch? the heart is a ≈øubtile piece, and will be ≈øtealing out to vanity, and if we are not careful, it will decoy us into ≈øin: we have a ≈øpecial eye upon ≈øuch per≈øons as we ≈øu≈øpect; thy heart is a ≈øu≈øpicious per≈øon: Oh! have an eye upon it, watch it continually: it is a bo≈øom Traitor, <hi>Job</hi> ≈øet a watch before his eyes, <hi>Job</hi> 31.1. We mu≈øt every day keep ≈øenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:77"/>≈øleep not upon your guard: our ≈øleeping time is the Devils tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time: let not your watch-candle go out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> You that are the people of God, do you often a≈ø≈øociate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>They that feared the Lord, ≈øpake often one to another. Chri≈øts</hi> Doves ≈øhall flock together: one <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> will help to heat ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: a ≈øingle coal of Juniper will ≈øoon die, but many coals put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will keep life in one another. Conference ≈øometimes may do as much as Preaching; one <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> by good di≈øcour≈øe drops holy Oyl upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, that makes the lamp of his Grace to ≈øhine the brighter.

God lifts off the burthen of ≈øin from the Con≈øcience, and lays it on Chri≈øts ≈øhoulder, and he carries it; now he that hath his burthen thus carried, <hi>it is well with him how≈øoever things go.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Forgivene≈øs of ≈øin and pardon, it is a crowning Ble≈ø≈øing, it is a Jewel of a Believers Crown, pardon of ≈øin is a multiplying mercy, it brings a great many mercies along with it: whom God pardons, he adopts, whom God pardons, he inve≈øts with Grace and Glory.</p>
            <p>So that this is a multiplying mercy; it is ≈øuch a mercy that is enough to make a ≈øick man well, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 33.24 <hi>The Inhabitants ≈øhall not ≈øay I am ≈øick; the people ≈øhall be forgiven their iniquity:</hi> The ≈øence of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

            <p n="2">2. <hi>However things go, it is well with the Righteous;</hi> becau≈øe that God is his portion, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 16.5. <hi>The Lord is the portion of my inheritance;</hi> the lines are fallen unto me in plea≈øant places: in God there are all good things to be found, and all that is in God is engaged for the good of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, his Power is to Help, and his Wi≈ødom is to Teach, and his Spirit is to Sanctifie, and his Mercy to Save. God is the Righteous mans porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and can God give a greater gift to us than him≈øelf? God is a rich portion, for he is the Angels riches; God is a ≈øafe and ≈øure portion, for his Name is <hi>a ≈øtrong Tower,</hi> he is a portion that can never be ≈øpent, for he is Infinitene≈øs: He is a portion can never be lo≈øt, for he is Eternity. <hi>Thou art my portion for ever,</hi> P≈øal. 72.26. and ≈øurely it is well with the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that hath God for his portion.

            <p>Thus I have cleared up the Doctrinal part. For the U≈øe to this,</p>
            <p>Here is abundance of comfort for every Godly man, for every per≈øon ≈øerving God in this Congregation, God hath ≈øent me this day with a Commi≈ø≈øion to comfort you.</p>
            <p>Oh! that I might drop in the Oyl of gladne≈øs into every broken heart
<pb facs="tcp:62760:81"/>and rejoyce every troubled ≈øpirit. Oh here is good news from Heaven <hi>Say unto the Righteous, it ≈øhall be well with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here is a que≈øtion mu≈øt be an≈øwered, You'l ≈øay to me, but how doth this appear, that it ≈øhall <hi>he well with the Righteous?</hi> for we often ≈øee it is the wor≈øt with them in this world, he is deprived of his comfort many times, he lo≈øes his very life in that quarrel, he is made the very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the world oftentimes; how then <hi>is it well with the Righteous?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I an≈øwer, yet ≈øtill <hi>it is well with the Righteous,</hi> though he meet with trouble in the world, and one follows on the neck of another, yet <hi>it is well with the Righteous;</hi> as will appear in the≈øe three or four particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The troubles that the Righteous man meets with, they turn to good, and ≈øo <hi>it is well with him;</hi> that is a mo≈øt famous Scripture in <hi>Jer.</hi> 24.5. <hi>Whom I have ≈øent out of this place unto the land of the Ghaldeans for their good.</hi> Gods own <hi>I≈ørael</hi> were tran≈øported into <hi>Babylon</hi> among their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: but it is for their good, ≈øaith the Lord. <hi>The troubles of the Righteous are a means to purge out their ≈øin.</hi> I have read a ≈øtory of one who running at another with a ≈øword to kill him, by accident his ≈øword run into an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øthume and broke the Impo≈øthume; thus all the evils and troubles of the Righteous ≈øerve but to cure them of the Impo≈øthume of pride, to make them more humble; when that the body of a Saint is afflicted, his ≈øoul, that revives and flouri≈øhes in Grace.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Rome</hi> there was two Laurel-trees, and when one withered, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did flouri≈øh: ≈øo when the body is afflicted, yet the ≈øoul that Laurel, doth revive and flouri≈øh.</p>
            <p>God doth di≈øtil our of the bittere≈øt drink his Glory and our Salvation, ≈øaith <hi>Jerome,</hi> that, that the world looks on as a puni≈øhment, God makes a medicine to heal the ≈øore; why then <hi>it ≈øhall be well with the Righteous.</hi> The rod of God upon a Saint, is but only Gods pencil whereby he draweth his Image more lively on the ≈øoul. God never ≈øtrikes the ≈øtrings of his Viol but to make the Mu≈øick ≈øweet. <hi>Then it is well with the Righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In the mid≈øt of all the trouble that doth befall the Righteous, yet ≈øtill it is well with them in regard of tho≈øe inward heart-revivings that God doth give them.</p>
            <p>We ≈øee a godly mans mi≈øery, but we do not ≈øee his comfort: we ≈øee his pri≈øon-gates, but we do not hear the mu≈øick that is within his Con≈øcience. God doth ≈øweeten to his People outward trouble with inward peace; it is the Title that is given to God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.6. <hi>God that comforteth them that are ca≈øt down.</hi> The Bee can gather honey as well from the thi≈øtle and from the bitter hearb, as from the ≈øweet flower; the Child of God can
<pb facs="tcp:62760:81"/>gather joy out of ≈øorrow: out of the very carka≈øs ≈øometimes the Lord gives honey; when the body is in pain, the ≈øoul may be at ea≈øe, as when a mans head akes, yet his heart may be well; thus <hi>it is well with the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous:</hi> God gives him that inward comfort that revives and ≈øweetens his outward pain.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the time of trouble and calamity, yet ≈øtill <hi>it is well with the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous:</hi> becau≈øe God doth cover his people, in the time of trouble, he hides them in the ≈øtorm, God hath a care to hide his Jewels, and will not let them be carried away; and thus he makes good that Scripture litterally, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 91.4. <hi>He ≈øhall cover them with his feathers, and under his wings ≈øhalt thou tru≈øt, no evil ≈øhall touch thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God oftentimes verifies this Scripture litterally, He makes his Angels to be his peoples life-guard; to hide them; and defend them, when a floud was coming upon the world, God provided an Ark to hide <hi>Noah,</hi> when <hi>I≈ørael</hi> is carried and tran≈øported into <hi>Babylon,</hi> God hid <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and gave him his life for a prey, <hi>Jer.</hi> 39.11. and in this ≈øen≈øe the Saints of God are called <hi>hidden ones, P≈øal.</hi> 83.3. Why ≈øo? not onely becau≈øe they are hid in Gods decree, and hid in Chri≈øts wounds, but oftentimes God hides them in a time of danger and calamity: they are <hi>hidden ones,</hi> he re≈øerved to him≈øelf ≈øeven thou≈øand that had not bowed the knee to <hi>Baal.</hi> The Prophet knew not where there was one, but God knew there were ≈øeven thou≈øand. In this ≈øen≈øe, <hi>it is well with the righteous</hi> in time of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick mi≈øery.</p>
            <p>I but you'l ≈øay, ≈øometimes it fares yet wor≈øe then all this, ≈øometimes the righteous they die and peri≈øh, they are carried away in a Tempe≈øt, why? <hi>yet ≈øtill it is well with the Righteous, and that in a two-fold ≈øen≈øe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Many times God doth take away the Righteous by death, and that in great mercy: he takes them away, that they ≈øhall not ≈øee the mi≈øery that comes upon a Nation. <hi>Virgil</hi> the Heathen Poet ≈øaith, <hi>They are happy that die before their Countrey:</hi> his meaning was, they die before they ≈øee the ruine of their Countrey: and truly God many times takes away his people in mercy, that they may not ≈øee the ruine that is coming on a Land; you have in Scripture for this, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14.13. <hi>He onely of Jeroboam ≈øhall come to the Grave in peace, becau≈øe in him there is found ≈øome good things towards the Lord God of I≈ørael,</hi> God puts him in his grave betimes in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, becau≈øe he ≈øhould not ≈øee the evil coming upon the Land: and there's a parallel to this, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 12. la≈øt. It is ≈øpoken of <hi>Jo≈øiah, I will gather thee unto thy Fathers, thou ≈øhalt be gathered unto thy Grave in peace, and thine eyes ≈øhall not ≈øee the evil I will bring upon this place. Jo≈øiah</hi> he dyed in Battel: how then was it ≈øaid he went to the Grave in peace? We mu≈øt
<pb facs="tcp:62760:82"/>under≈øtand the meaning of it is this; <hi>Jo≈øiah</hi> went to his Grave in peace, becau≈øe he was a holy man, and he had made his peace with God, and ≈øo he went to his Grave in peace; and becau≈øe he ≈øhould not ≈øee the evil ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, God gathered him to his Grave in peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jerom</hi> ≈øpeaking of his friend <hi>Nepotian</hi> (you mu≈øt ob≈øerve <hi>Jerom</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ≈øee ≈øome troubles before he died) ≈øaith he, Oh! how happy is my friend <hi>Nepotian,</hi> that ≈øees not the≈øe troubles, but is got out of the ≈øtorm, dies and is arrived ≈øafe in Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luther</hi> died in mercy before the trouble in <hi>Germany</hi> broke forth: and thus you ≈øee the Righteous though they die, <hi>yet it is well with them,</hi> God takes them away in mercy that they may not ≈øee approaching evils.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though the Righteous die, and are taken away, <hi>yet it is well with them,</hi> becau≈øe death cannot hurt them: Death can neither hurt their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy nor yet their ≈øouls, and then it is well with them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Death cannot hurt their bodies, the body of a Saint it doth not peri≈øh, though it die; the bodies of the Saints are very precious du≈øt in Gods account: precious du≈øt, The Lord locks up the≈øe Jewels in the Grave, as in a Cabinet; The bodies of the Saints lie mellowing and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening in the Grave till the ble≈ø≈øed time of the Re≈øurrection. Oh! how precious is the Du≈øt of a Believer, though the world mind it not, yet it is precious unto God. The Husbandman he hath ≈øome Corn in his Barn, and he hath other Corn in the Ground: why? the Corn that is in the ground, is as precious to him, as that is in the Barn: the bodies of the Saints in the Grave, are Gods Corn in the ground, but the Lord makes very precious account of this Corn: The bodies of the Saints ≈øhall be more glorious and ble≈ø≈øed then ever they were, at the Re≈øurrection. <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> calls them <hi>Angelical bodies,</hi> in regard of that beauty and lu≈øtre that ≈øhall be upon them. As it is with your ≈øilks, when they are died of a purple or ≈øcarlet colour, they are made more bright and illu≈øtrious then they were before; thus it is with the bodies of the Saints, they ≈øhall be dyed of a better colour at the Re≈øurrection, <hi>they ≈øhall be made like a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body;</hi> Phil. 3.20. thus it ≈øhall be well with the righteous, their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ≈øhall not peri≈øh.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It will be well with the Righteous at death, as to their ≈øouls too. Oh it will be a ble≈ø≈øed time! methinks it is with a Saint at the time of death, ju≈øt as it was with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his voyage to <hi>Rome,</hi> we read that the Ship did break, but though there were ≈øo many broken pieces, yet he got ≈øafe to ≈øhore; ≈øo though the Ship of the Believers body break by death, yet it is ≈øafe with the pa≈ø≈øenger, his ≈øoul that gets ≈øafe to the Heavenly harbour: Let me tell you, the day of a Believers death,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:82"/>it is the birth-day of his ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe, it is his A≈øcention day to Heaven, the day of his death, it is his marriage-day with Je≈øus Chri≈øt. Faith doth but contract us here, in this life is but the contract, but at death the Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials ≈øhall be ≈øolemnized in Glory, they ≈øhall ≈øee God face to face, it will be Heaven enough to have a ≈øight of God, ≈øaith <hi>Au≈øtin:</hi> when the Saints ≈øhall enter into joy, here joy enters into them, but then they ≈øhall enter into it: they ≈øhall drink of the≈øe pure Rivers that run from the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la≈øting Fountain.</p>
            <p>And thus you ≈øee, <hi>it will be well with the Righteous, how ever things go,</hi> though trouble come, though death come, <hi>yet it will go well with the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi> And Oh let tho≈øe that are the people of God comfort them≈øelves in the≈øe words! Oh what an encouragement is this to all you that hear me, to begin to be Righteous! this Text may tempt us all to be Godly, <hi>Say unto the Righteous, it ≈øhall be well with him;</hi> when things are never ≈øo ill with him, yet it is well with him.</p>
            <p>We would be glad to have things go well with our Relations, and in our E≈øtates; why? when the Righteous things go well with us, thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon is ≈øealed, thou art Heir of all Gods Promi≈øes, thou art Chri≈øts favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, thou ha≈øt Heaven in rever≈øion, and is it not now well with thee? If you would have Happine≈øs, you mu≈øt e≈øpou≈øe Holine≈øs. <hi>Say unto the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, it ≈øhall be well with them:</hi> and thus much of the fir≈øt Propo≈øition, the Godly mans comfort in <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>death, it is well with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now if all this will not prevail with you, to make you leave your fins and become Righteous, I mu≈øt pa≈ø≈øe in a few words to the next branch of the Text, to ≈øcare men out of their ≈øin, to affright men out of their wickedne≈ø≈øe, <hi>Wo unto the wicked, it ≈øhall be ill with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This my Beloved is the dark fide of the cloud.</p>
            <p>It may cau≈øe in every wicked man that hears me, a trembling at the heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wo unto the wicked, it ≈øhall be ill with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Propo≈øition that doth re≈øi≈øt out of the≈øe words, is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> When things ≈øeem to be well with the wicked men, it ≈øhall be ill with them at la≈øt, though they have more then heart can wi≈øh, yet it ≈øhall be ill with them at la≈øt, <hi>Eccle≈ø.</hi> 8.13. <hi>It ≈øhall not be well with the wicked, nor ≈øhall he prolong his daies, which are as a ≈øhadow;</hi> becau≈øe he fears not God, it ≈øhall not be well with the wicked, the God of truth hath pronounced this.</p>
            <p>It is as true as God is true, <hi>it ≈øhall not be well with the wicked.</hi>

            <p n="4">4.

Oh! but there is no way but to Hell, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.23. <hi>In Hell he lifted up his eyes.</hi> Hell, 'tis the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry center of mi≈øery, 'tis the very Spirits of Torments di≈øtilled out: The Scripture tells us, that in Hell there are the≈øe three things; there is <hi>Fire,</hi> there is <hi>Darkne≈øs,</hi> there are <hi>Chains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Hell is called a place of <hi>Darkne≈øs,</hi> Jude 13. <hi>To whom is re≈øerved blackne≈øs of darkne≈øs:</hi> Darkne≈øs you know is the mo≈øt uncomfortable thing in the world; a man that goes in the dark, he trembleth every ≈øtep he goeth.</p>
            <p>Hell is a black Region, nothing but blackne≈øs of darkne≈øs; and it mu≈øt needs be a dark place where they ≈øhall be ≈øeparated from the light of Gods pre≈øence. Indeed <hi>Augu≈øtine,</hi> he thinks there ≈øhall be ≈øome little ≈øulphurous light there: but ≈øuppo≈øe it be ≈øo, that light ≈øhall ≈øerve onely that the damned may ≈øee the tragedy of their own mi≈øery, and ≈øee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves tormented.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In Hell, as there is <hi>Darkne≈øs,</hi> ≈øo there is <hi>Fire,</hi> it is called a burning Lake, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Who was not found written in the book of Life, was threwn into the Lake of Fire.</hi> You know that Fire is the mo≈øt torturing Element, it makes the mo≈øt dreadful impre≈ø≈øion on the fle≈øh. Now Hell is a place of Fire.</p>
            <p>It is di≈øputed among the Learned what kind of fire it is, and I wi≈øh we may never know what kind of fire it is. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> and others affirm that it is Material fire, but far hotter than any fire upon your Hearths, that is but painted fire compared with this. But I do rather think that the fire of the Damned it is partly Material, and partly Spiritual; partly Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial to work on the Body, and partly Spiritual, which is the wrath of God to torment the ≈øoul: that is the Lake, the burning Fire: Oh! who knows the power of Gods anger? who can dwell with the≈øe burnings? it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable to endure them, and impo≈ø≈øible to e≈øcape them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In Hell there are chains, <hi>chains of darkne≈øs.</hi> Tho≈øe ≈øinners that would not be bound by any Law of God, ≈øuch ≈øhall have chains of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs to bind them.</p>
            <p>Que≈øt, <hi>What ≈øhould be the meaning of the≈øe phra≈øes,</hi> Chains of darkne≈øs?</p>

               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> I ≈øuppo≈øe it may be this, to intimate unto us, that the wicked in Hell ≈øhall not have power to walk up and down, which perhaps might be a little ea≈øe, though very little; but they ≈øhall be chained down fa≈øt, not to ≈øtir, they ≈øhall be fa≈øtned to that ≈øtake with chains of darkne≈øs; Oh! this will be terrible indeed. Suppo≈øe a man ≈øhould lie always on a Doun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and might not ≈øtir out of the place, it would be very painful unto him: Oh; but to lye as the Damned upon the wrack, always under the torturing ≈øcorchings of Gods wrath, and to be tyed, and not to move, how dreadful are the thoughts of this? and this is the condition of the wicked, <hi>they are under fire, and darkne≈øs, and chains.</hi>

            <p>And to add unto the torments of Hell, there are the≈øe two things more to ≈øhew you, <hi>that it ≈øhall be ill with the wicked,</hi> let them dye when they will.</p>

            <p>

Tho≈øe Sinners that would never hear the voice of Con≈øcience, they ≈øhall feel the worm of Con≈øcience. And then,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As there is the Worm to torment, ≈øo there is the Serpent, that is the Devil, who is called the Old Serpent, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. As there is the biting of the Worm, ≈øo there is the ≈øtinging of the Old Serpent.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt of all, The Damned ≈øhall be forced to behold the Devil.

            <p>Satan is full of rage again≈øt Mankind, and will ≈øhew no mercy, as he puts forth all his ≈øubtilty in tempting of man, ≈øo he puts out all his crue'ty in tormenting of Mankind. And this is not all,</p>

Oh how ≈øad is this! to lie down in the ≈øcalding furnace of Gods wrath, and none to pity them; when they cry out, God will laugh at them.

            <p>MY Beloved, I do very well remember that upon the 24th of this in≈øtant month, in 1651. I was then under the ≈øentence of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment; and that very day did I preach my <hi>Farewel Sermon</hi>

            <list>
               <item>1. Is this ≈øo? ought the Pa≈øtors ≈øo to love their People? Give me leave to be≈øpeak you in the words of <hi>Job,</hi> (in re≈øpect of tho≈øe hundreds of Mini≈øters, that are to be plucked from their people:) <hi>Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, Oh ye my friends! for the hand of God hath touched me,</hi> Job 19.21. What will nothing ≈øerve but plucking out our very eyes? our very heart (being ≈øo much the objects of the peoples love?) how ≈øad is it for the Father to be pluckt from the Child, the Shepheard from the Flock, the Nur≈øe from the Child? this is a lamentation, and ought to be for a lamentation, that there mu≈øt be a parting between <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan,</hi> who loved one another as their own ≈øouls; this cuts them to their very heart. And this I may ≈øay in re≈øpect to my ≈øelf, I ble≈øs God, I cannot ≈øay as ≈øhe of her Husband, <hi>A bloudy Husband ha≈øt thou been unto me: but a loving Congregation have you been unto me.</hi> I know none of you have de≈øired my de≈øtruction, nor to taint my name; never did I hear three in this Congregation ≈øpeak of pre≈ø≈øing any thing again≈øt me, that was contrary to my Con≈øcience, nor can I ≈øay, that there are four in this Pari≈øh that did ever deny to pay me my <hi>legal due,</hi> ble≈ø≈øed be God for ≈øuch a people; you have not encroached upon my Con≈øcience, as I hope I have not upon yours. Pa≈øtors mu≈øt love their people, do not blame them if their hearts be almo≈øt broken, when they are to part with ≈øuch a people.</item>
               <item>2. Mu≈øt the Pa≈øtor love his people? then the people mu≈øt love their Pa≈øtor. Tis true, it lies in the power of man to ≈øeparate Pa≈øtor and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but not to ≈øeparate their hearts; I hope there will never be a ≈øepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of love, but that will ≈øtill continue; if we do not ≈øee one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet we may love one another, and pray for one another, I hope a Husband doth not cea≈øe from loving his Wife becau≈øe ≈øhe is ab≈øent from him. But Oh! for my Brethren, hundreds of them think that you are undone, but you are not undone, though you cannot ≈øee as far as other men, you may live in love and keep your con≈øcience quiet.</item>
               <item>3. Mu≈øt Pa≈øtors love their People? then you may ≈øee from hence <hi>what ≈øhould be the grand object of the Pa≈øtors affection,</hi> i. e. <hi>the People,</hi> not what the people have. This is the great enquiry, what's the Benefice worth? what is the preferment? do they pay well, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereas we ≈øhould not ≈øeek ≈øo much the Fleece as the Flock, we ≈øhould not take over≈øight of a
<pb facs="tcp:62760:88"/>Congregation for love of their <hi>pay,</hi> but of their <hi>≈øouls;</hi> not, <hi>'tis an excellent good living,</hi> as one ≈øaid I have heard of, <hi>let me have their Tythes, and let their ≈øouls go to the Devil;</hi> but as the Apo≈øtle, <hi>I ≈øeek not yours, but you,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.14. And I hope there be many hundreds can ≈øay, it hath been the peoples ≈øouls they have more loved and affected, than any thing that the people had.</item>
               <item>4. Once more: We mu≈øt love them, and love them tenderly; why, and yet leave them? Yes my Beloved, we are ≈øo to love our People, as to venture any thing for them, but our own damnation. I come not here to throw fire-brands, I ble≈øs God I have a mo≈øt tender affection for all my Brethren in the <hi>Mini≈øtry;</hi> and though I am not ≈øatisfied my ≈øelf, yet I condemn no man; I believe there be many of them do as con≈øcientiou≈øly ≈øub≈øcribe, as deny to ≈øub≈øcribe. I prote≈øt in the fear of God, I cannot ≈øub≈øcribe, perhaps it is becau≈øe I have not that light as others have; <hi>for he that doubts,</hi> ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, <hi>is Damned.</hi> My Beloved, I hope you would not have us ≈øin again≈øt God and our own con≈øciences: it is not my <hi>Living</hi> that I de≈øire, but my <hi>Office</hi> to ≈øerve my <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Ma≈øter;</hi> but if we ≈øhould, to keep communion with you, lo≈øe our communion with God, this is the ready way to have all our labour and pains lo≈øt; but as <hi>David</hi> ≈øaid, (and Oh that I could ≈øpeak it with as good hopes as <hi>David!</hi>) <hi>Zadock, carry back the Ark of God, If I ≈øhall find favour in the eyes of the Lord, he will bring me again, and ≈øhew me both it and his Habitation,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Sam. 15.25. Brethren, I could do very much for the love I bear to you, but I dare not ≈øin; I know they will tell you, this is Pride and Peevi≈øhne≈øs in us, and are tender of our Reputation, and we would fain all be <hi>Bi≈øhops,</hi> and forty things more: but the Lord be witne≈øs between them and us in this. Beloved, I prefer my Wife and Children before a bla≈øt of air of peoples talk; I am very ≈øen≈øible what it is to be reduced to a mor≈øel of bread: let the God of Heaven and Earth do what he will with me, if I could have ≈øub≈øcribed with a good con≈øcience, I would; <hi>I</hi> would do any thing to keep my ≈øelf in the work of God, but to ≈øin again≈øt my God, <hi>I</hi> dare not do it.</item>

               <item>2. If the peoples growth in grace and knowledge, be matter of Joy to a faithful Pa≈øtor: then what do you think of tho≈øe that hinder their thriving? I ≈øhall give you two Scriptures, <hi>John</hi> 12.19. <hi>The Phari≈øees therefore ≈øaid among them≈øelves</hi> (they dur≈øt not ≈øpeak publickly; but who was it again≈øt? why, it was again≈øt Chri≈øt) <hi>perceive ye how ye prevail no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? behold the world is gone after him.</hi> But we will order him for that, we will le≈ø≈øen his Congregation; if we cannot do that, we will ≈øhut the doors again≈øt him; ≈øee <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.13. <hi>Woe unto you Scribes and Phari≈øees, Hypocrites, for ye ≈øhut up the Kingdom of Heaven again≈øt men:</hi> what! ≈øhut up the Kingdom of Heaven again≈øt men! what the <hi>Phari≈øees,</hi> that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended they had the <hi>Keys of Heaven,</hi> and to be the <hi>guides!</hi> I, that it is, becau≈øe there is not room enough in Heaven for us and them too? <hi>No,</hi> faith Chri≈øt, <hi>there is no ≈øuch matter, for ye neither go in your ≈øelves, neither ≈øuffer ye them that are entring to go in.</hi> I dare not tell you at this time, what it is to <hi>≈øhut up the Kingdom of Heaven again≈øt men,</hi> you may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter imagine it than I can ≈øpeak it; but thus did the <hi>Phari≈øees, they would not go in them≈øelves, nor ≈øuffer them that were entring to go in.</hi> I remember when I was a Child, we had ≈øuch a Mini≈øter, that would one Lords day preach up Holine≈øs, and the next Lords day preach again≈øt the practice of Holine≈øs.</item>

                  <item>3. <hi>That the fixed, ≈øtanding, flouri≈øhing, and thriving of that flock in the profe≈ø≈øion and practice of Go≈øpel-knowledge and obedience, is matter of tran≈øcendent joy and triumph to ≈øuch a godly Pa≈øtor.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list> The fourth, which is that I would now pro≈øecute, is this, <hi>That it is the grand and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di≈øpen≈øible duty of all ≈øincere Saints, in the mo≈øt black and ≈øhaking ≈øea≈øons, to ≈øtand fa≈øt, fixed, and ≈øtedfa≈øt in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a grand thing St. <hi>Paul</hi> had to ≈øay to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> when he was ready to have his head cut off; for ≈øo it was, he was beheaded for the te≈øtimony of Je≈øus: this is all he had to ≈øay, when in <hi>Goal,</hi> and in <hi>Bonds,</hi> and that under <hi>Heathen Romans;</hi> you are now my <hi>Joy,</hi> you are now my <hi>Crown;</hi> Oh! do but ≈øtand, and my Joy, which is but two notes above <hi>Gamut,</hi> will get to <hi>Ela:</hi> Oh! do but ≈øtand, and my Crown is ≈øtudded with Diamonds: we live if you ≈øtand, though we dye when you ≈øtand. <hi>It is the great and indi≈øpen≈øible Duty,</hi> &amp;c. Whether the≈øe are <hi>black</hi> and <hi>≈øhaking ≈øea≈øons,</hi> I have nothing to ≈øay, but I am wholly now upon your <hi>Duty Beloved,</hi> and for Gods ≈øake let the words of a <hi>≈øeemingly dying Mini≈øter</hi> prevail with you. There is a kind of a Maxim among ≈øome, that in ca≈øe a per≈øon dye ≈øeemingly and revive again, that the la≈øt words that was heard of that per≈øon, when in a rational temper, are the onely things that that per≈øon will remember, when brought to life again. It is mo≈øt probably Beloved, what ever others may think, but in my opinion <hi>(God may work wonders)</hi> neither you nor I ≈øhall ever ≈øee the faces of, or have a word to ≈øpeak to one another till the day of <hi>Judgement.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I be≈øeech you hear me, as tho≈øe that would, and may live with me to Eternity: mark your Duty, I have ≈øpoken ≈øomething concerning the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtors</hi> Duty in the morning; now for the <hi>peoples. It is the indi≈øpen≈øible duty of all ≈øincere Saints, to ≈øtand fa≈øt,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>In the wor≈øt of times, in the mo≈øt ≈øhaking ≈øea≈øons, and if I do not greatly mi≈øtake, there is an hour of Temptation threatned by God, now beginning to be inflicted: if ever you would ≈øtand, ≈øtand now; and for your comfort let me but hint, that a Chri≈øtian may ≈øtand comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, when he falls ≈øadly, that is, he may ≈øtand by God. when he falls by man: <hi>I</hi> knew that a great many years ago.</p>

As there can be no bitterer War than between con≈øcience and the ear, ≈øo there can be no ≈øweeter Peace, than when Mercy and Peace meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and when Con≈øcience and Peace ki≈øs each other: The former is the ta≈øte of Heaven, the latter is the perambulation of Heaven; both which the Believer ≈øhares in upon his Ju≈øtification by faith. If Chri≈øt had peace, who was made our ≈øin, needs mu≈øt the Believer have peace, who is made the Righteou≈øne≈øs of God in him.</p>
            <p>Seconly, Sanctifying grace hath a peace attending it, and this peace differs from the former, as the Root from the Fruit. The peace of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtification is a radical Peace, the root of Peace; but the Peace of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is the bud, the blo≈ø≈øom of the Tree: the former flows from the bloud of Chri≈øt ≈øprinkled on the Con≈øcience, the latter from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity that is between the Word and the Will, between the Commands and the Con≈øcience; <hi>As many as walk according to this Rule, grace be unto them and peace,</hi> Gal. 6.16. So that Peace is the fruit of ≈øanctifying Grace. Now as the bloud of the <hi>Pa≈øcal-Lamb,</hi> (which was a token of peace) was not to be ≈øtruck on the po≈øts of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> but upon the po≈øts of the <hi>I≈øraelites;</hi> ≈øo neither is the bloud of ≈øprinkling, which brings perfect peace, to be ≈øtruck on the Po≈øts of the carnal Sinner, but on the Po≈øts of the true Believer, an <hi>I≈øraelite</hi> indeed, in whom there is no guile; no Grace, no
<pb facs="tcp:62760:99"/>Peace, that is Gods Law. How can a ≈øinner have peace in a ≈øtate of ≈øin, when God and con≈øcience, when Word and con≈øcience, when Law and con≈øcience, and all the Attributes of God are again≈øt a ≈øinner? <hi>No Peace ≈øaith my God to the wicked.</hi> Pray mark that chapter, it begins with the peace, and ends in no peace. In <hi>ver.</hi> 2. it is ≈øaid, <hi>He ≈øhall enter into peace,</hi> that is, the Righteous: in the la≈øt ver≈øe, <hi>There is no peace to the wicked.</hi> It is the ≈øtate of Grace that is the only ≈øtate of peace. And thus I pa≈øs from the double Grace de≈øired, Grace and Peace; to the double Fountain di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, <hi>God our Father, and our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here's a que≈øtion to be an≈øwered, <hi>If Grace and Peace be from God the Father, then how is it ≈øaid to be from Chri≈øt? and if from Chri≈øt, how then from God the Father?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> It's a known Rule, that the tran≈øial external works of God are attributed to all the three <hi>Per≈øons</hi> in the <hi>Trinity;</hi> the ≈øame works that are attributed to the <hi>Father,</hi> are al≈øo attributed to the <hi>Son;</hi> and the ≈øame works are attributed to the <hi>Son,</hi> the ≈øame al≈øo to the <hi>Father:</hi> ≈øo Grace and Peace are here a≈øcribed both to God the Father, and our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt; that is, they are both from Mercy, and from Merit. From Mercy on Gods part to us, from Merit on Chri≈øts part for us; they are from <hi>God the Father,</hi> becau≈øe he wills them to us, from <hi>God the Son,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he works them in us: they are from <hi>God to Chri≈øt,</hi> from <hi>Chri≈øt to us;</hi> they are from <hi>God the Father</hi> originally, and from <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> derivatively, and <hi>to us</hi> actually: <hi>God the Father</hi> is the <hi>fountain</hi> of all <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Peace, Chri≈øt</hi> as <hi>Mediator</hi> is the <hi>Conduit</hi> of all <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Peace; Man</hi> in union to <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> is the ci≈øtern into which the≈øe ≈øtreams of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> runs; God wils <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> to us, &amp; Chri≈øt works them in us; God gives <hi>Grace</hi> &amp; <hi>Peace</hi> to be applied to the Creature, this is from the love of the <hi>Father,</hi> but the Application of this peace to the ≈øoul, is from the Merit of <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> the <hi>Redeemer:</hi> Thus you ≈øee there's a double ≈øpring of this double ble≈ø≈øing. Time will not ≈øerve me further: The only Ob≈øervation, is;</p>
            <p>That all the Grace and Peace which Believers ≈øhare in, is derived from <hi>God the Father</hi> through our <hi>Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt:</hi> the≈øe three things opened will clear this;

                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>e;</hi> if Grace is, then Peace is. But Grace is the priviledge of every Believer, and that whether you look upon it as taken from the love and favour of God to us; this is the Believers priviledge. God can as well forget Chri≈øt at his right hand, as cea≈øe his love and favour to the ≈øoul of a Believer; the Believers
<pb facs="tcp:62760:100"/>title to all their ble≈ø≈øings ari≈øes out of this never-failing love of God; or if you aske grace for the fruit of Gods love to the ≈øoul, ≈øtill it falls to the Believers priviledge, <hi>Vocation, Ju≈øtification, Adoption, pardon of Sin, purging from Sin, ≈øtrength again≈øt ≈øin, Holine≈øs, Faith, Love, Obedience, Per≈øeverance;</hi> all the≈øe are the priviledges of every Believer; nay, a man cannot be a Believer without any one of them, they are as e≈ø≈øential to the Being of a Chri≈øtian, as rea≈øon to the Being of a man.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>As Grace, ≈øo Peace is the Believers priviledge:</hi> There is <hi>peace external, peace ≈øupernal, peace internal,</hi> and <hi>peace eternal:</hi> There is <hi>peace external,</hi> this peace with men; there is <hi>peace ≈øupernal,</hi> that is peace with God; there is <hi>peace internal,</hi> that is peace with Con≈øcience: all the≈øe three are to be had here upon earth; and then there is <hi>peace eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> and that is only to be had in Heaven. The Apo≈øtle here doth not exclude the former, but chiefly intends the latter: peace with man is a good thing to be de≈øired, but peace with God and Con≈øcience is much more to be de≈øired. Peace with God is the ≈øpring of all things both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and without, both below and above, both in time and eternity: ≈øo ≈øaith <hi>Job, if he gives peace, who then can make tro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>ble?</hi> Now this peace is the Saints priviledge. it is a Legacy left to every Believer, by the la≈øt Will and Te≈øtament of a dying Redeemer. Will you ≈øee a copy of his Will, then look in <hi>Job.</hi> 14.27. <hi>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you, not as the world giveth, give I unto you.</hi> There is, it ≈øeems, a peace in the worlds power to give, and there is a peace of Chri≈øts be≈øtowing. Now Chri≈øt would have us here not to mi≈øtake the worlds peace for his, for the difference is very great; for fir≈øt, the worlds peace is a fal≈øe peace, it is counterfeit coin, it hath not the current ≈øtamp of Heaven on it; but the peace that Chri≈øt gives to a Believer, is true peace, and perfect peace:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou will keep him in perfect peace who≈øe mind is ≈øtayed on thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Worlds peace</hi> is an <hi>outward peace,</hi> it is but skin deep, it wets the mouth, cannot wa≈øh the heart, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.13. <hi>In laughter the heart is ≈øorrowful, and the end of that mirth is heavine≈øs.</hi> The worlds peace is but the ≈øhell of peace; their Con≈øcience lowers, when their countenance laughs: but the peace that Chri≈øt gives, is an inward and ≈øpiritual peace, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Thou ha≈øt put gladne≈øs in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increa≈øed. Thou ha≈øt put gladne≈øs in my heart:</hi> Peace is that gladne≈øs, or peace ≈ømooths the brow, but this fills the brea≈øt, as the finner hath trouble within, in the mid≈øt of all his peace without: <hi>In the world you ≈øhall have trouble, but in me you ≈øhall have peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The worlds peace has only a neather ≈øpring ari≈øing out of the Creature, out of worldly comforts, therefore it mu≈øt needs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean;
<pb facs="tcp:62760:100"/>
               <hi>for an unclean fountain cannot bring forth clean water.</hi> But the peace of Chri≈øtians has an upper ≈øpring, it flows from the manife≈øtation of the love of God in Chri≈øt: it is from the ≈øprinkling of Chri≈øts bloud on the con≈øcience, it flows upon the workings of Chri≈øts Spirit upon the Soul, which is fir≈øt a Coun≈øellor, then a Comforter. Oh how pure mu≈øt this peace be in a believers ≈øoul, that flows from ≈øo pure a ≈øpring!</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The worlds peace is a peace given to ≈øinners, it is a peace in ≈øin, and it is a peace with ≈øin, as the Prophet <hi>I≈øaiah</hi> tell us, <hi>It is a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with Hell, and an Agreement with Death</hi> (God delivers us from that peace.) Again, Chri≈øts peace is given to none but believers, it is their priviledge onely, a ≈øtranger doth not intermeddle with his joy, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.10. <hi>The heart knoweth his own bitterne≈øs, but a ≈øtranger doth not intermeddle with his joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, The worlds peace is a fading, dying, tran≈øitory thing, it wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the Sand, <hi>The tryumphing of the wicked is but ≈øhort, and the joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment,</hi> Job 20.5. <hi>Solomon</hi> doth elegantly liken it to <hi>crackling of thorns under a pot,</hi> which is but a blaze and is gone, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.6. ≈øo is the ≈øinners peace, it is for a ≈øpurt and is ≈øoon gone, but the peace that Chri≈øt gives to Believers, is a durable and abiding peace. Your joy no man ≈øhall take from you, it appears in life, in death, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death: fir≈øt it is our peace in life, grace brings forth pre≈øent peace. It is ≈øaid of the Primitive Chri≈øtians, <hi>They walked in the fear of the Lord, and in the comforts of the Holy Gho≈øt,</hi> Act. 9.41. It is a remarkable expre≈ø≈øion, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 19.11. <hi>In keeping thy Commands there is great reward:</hi> He don't ≈øay for keeping them, which re≈øpects the end of the work, but in keeping them, which looks at the work it ≈øelf: My brethren, every duty done in ≈øincerity, reflects a peace in con≈øcience, as every flower carries its own ≈øweetne≈øs. It is po≈ø≈øible, I grant, a Believer may not always find and feel this peace; few do, ≈øome ≈øeldom find it, few find it always: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of corruption bringing forth to interrupt, or temptations to hinder, and Gods di≈ø≈øertion may darken and hide it, and a Believer may ≈øeem to be totally lo≈øt: yet in this condition, which is the wor≈øt a child of God can be in, he hath a double peace: fir≈øt, a peace in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes, in this very condition, and what you have in Bonds and Bills you account as good as money in your pockets. Secondly, he hath it in the ≈øeed, <hi>Light is ≈øown for the righteous, and gladne≈øs for the upright in heart,</hi> P≈øal. 97.11. Grace is the ≈øeed of Peace, which Chri≈øt hath ≈øown in the furrows of the ≈øoul, and therefore peace ≈øhall ≈øpring out of the furrows of the ≈øoul. Indeed this ≈øeed ≈øprings up ≈øooner in ≈øome than in others, yet every Saint ≈øhall have a reaping time ≈øooner or later, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 126.6.
<pb facs="tcp:62760:101"/>
               <hi>He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious ≈øeed, ≈øhall doubtle≈øs come again with rejoycing, bringing his ≈øheaves with him:</hi> If he ≈øtaies long for the fruit, he ≈øhall have a greater crop at la≈øt, if he reaps not now, he ≈øhall be ≈øure to reap hereafter, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 37. <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>t, for the end of that man is peace.</hi> Secondly, by this peace which is the peace of a Child of God, it is a peace at death; Grace will Mini≈øter to us then, and that Mini≈øtration ≈øhall be Peace; the ≈øinners peace leaves him when he comes to the grave; though in life it fills him, yet in death it leaves him. A Believer hath a two-fold ≈øpring of peace, the fir≈øt is from above him, the other from within him: That ≈øpring that runs with peace above him, is from the bloud of Chri≈øt ≈øprinkled on his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience: the other that is from within him, is from the ≈øincerity of his heart in the ways of Obedience. My Brethren, when we lye on our death-beds, and can reflect on our ≈øincerity in all Gods ways, this will be peace at la≈øt, ≈øo it was in <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> I≈øai. 38.3. <hi>Remember now, O Lord, I be≈øeech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which was good in thy ≈øight.</hi> There's nothing makes a death-bed ≈øo hard and ≈øo unea≈øie, as a life ≈øpent in the ≈øervice of ≈øin and lu≈øt, and nothing makes a death-bed ≈øo plea≈øant as a life ≈øpent in the ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Chri≈øt: Grace will bring forth Peace, if not in this life: yet <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it will be ≈øure after death: if time brings not this fruit to ripene≈øs, yet Eternity ≈øhall, Grace in time, will be Glory in Eternity, Holine≈øs now will be Happine≈øs then; whatever it is a man ≈øows in this world, that he reaps in the next world: <hi>be not deceived, God is not mocked, for what≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a man ≈øoweth, that ≈øhall he al≈øo reap; he that ≈øoweth to the fle≈øh ≈øhall of the fle≈øh reap corruption, but he that ≈øoweth to the ≈øpirit, ≈øhall of the ≈øpirit reap life everla≈øting,</hi> Gal. 6.7, 8. When Sin ≈øhall end in ≈øorrow and mi≈øery, Grace ≈øhall end in peace, in joy, in glory; <hi>well done thou good and faithful ≈øervant, enter into the joy of thy Ma≈øter.</hi> Mat. 25.21. Whoever ≈øhares in the Grace of Chri≈øt in this world, ≈øhall be ≈øure to ≈øhare with the joy of Chri≈øt in the next world, &amp; that joy is joy un≈øpeakable<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> &amp; full of glory; I will wind up all in a three-fold Application, by way of Exhortation, to three ≈øorts of per≈øons.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt, To ≈øuch as have both Grace and Peace;</hi> Ile ≈øpeak to them in two or three things. <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> Admire thankfully the Father &amp; the Son, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Grace, and the Sons Love, for both had a hand in this, therefore ble≈øs both the Father for willing it to us, and the Son for working it in us; Grace and Peace are the fruits of Gods eternal Election, for this ble≈ø≈øing the Father gives, but the Application of it to us is the
<pb facs="tcp:62760:101"/>fruits of Chri≈øts redemption and interce≈ø≈øion. How can you think of <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Damnation,</hi> and ≈øee your ≈øelf freed from it? And how can you think of the dreadful fury and vengeance of God, your ≈øelf not under it? How can you look on your ≈øtate change, your heart renewed, Grace ratified and reconciled, and your Con≈øcience quieted? How can you think of the≈øe things, but mu≈øt admire the love of the Father in giving this to you, and the love of the Son in purcha≈øing this for you? All Grace and Mercy that is given to us, is by Chri≈øt purcha≈øed for us; Grace and Peace are fruits of the redeeming bloud of Chri≈øt purcha≈øed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Do not envy the conditions and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions of the men of the world; they have riches and honours, profits and plea≈øures, but they neither have Grace nor Peace, therefore do not envy their happine≈øs. There is a ≈øtory of a <hi>Roman</hi> that was condemned by a <hi>Court-Mar≈øhal</hi> to dye for breaking his rank to ≈øteal a bunch of Grapes; and as he was going to his Execution, his fellow Souldiers laughed at him, and others envied at him that he ≈øhould have Grapes and they none: Now (≈øaith he) <hi>do not envy me for my bunch of Grapes, for you would be loath to have them at the rate I mu≈øt pay for them.</hi> (My Brethren) You that are the children of Grace and Peace, do not envy at men of the world, at their riches and their comforts, their plea≈øures; for I am ≈øure you would be loath to have them at the price they pay for them; for the end of the≈øe things is death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> do not complain of the wor≈øt condition that the providence of God ≈øhall ca≈øt you into; in this it may be you ≈øhall ≈øuffer hard things, but remember, ≈øo long as thy ≈øoul is ≈øecure, never complain of hard things. (My brethren) as God your Father brought you into a ≈øtate of Grace and Peace, and thereby ≈øecured his love to your ≈øouls in Chri≈øt, can you complain of hard things? So let the joy of the Lord be your ≈øtrength, <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord always, and again I ≈øay, rejoyce,</hi> Phil. 4.4.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond U≈øe is, to ≈øuch as have neither Grace nor Peace: May not I ≈øay, I ≈øpeak to many ≈øuch? I would I might not. Are there not many that are without Grace, and therefore mu≈øt needs be without peace? They may have the worlds peace, but they have none of this peace; let me beg of you to get out of this Gracele≈øs ≈øtate. Oh that you would believe the words of a dying man, for ≈øo I am to you, and ≈øuch words u≈øe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred. Oh remember this as a te≈øtimony I leave with you, that love of <hi>Sin,</hi> and lack of <hi>Grace,</hi> will ruine and de≈øtroy every ≈øoul at la≈øt. But you will ≈øay, How ≈øhall I get a ≈øhare in this Grace and Peace?</p>
            <p>I an≈øwer, <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> Break off all your fal≈øe peace: we can never have true
<pb facs="tcp:62760:102"/>peace with God, when we content our ≈øelves with fal≈øe peace; you will never ≈øeek that <hi>peace</hi> which <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> hath <hi>purcha≈øed</hi> for <hi>you,</hi> while <hi>you</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent your ≈øelves with that <hi>cur≈øed peace</hi> which the <hi>Old man</hi> hath <hi>wrought</hi> in you: Oh therefore break off all fal≈øe peace, which is not the fruit of grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Labour to ≈øee and be convinced of the mi≈øerable, and of the naked condition your ≈øouls be in, for want of the righteou≈øne≈øs of <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> for a covering, without this, ≈øoul, thou art mi≈øerable, wretched, poor and naked: be convinced al≈øo what a mi≈øerable thing it is to have God our enemy; God is the ≈øinners en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>y, <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi> Oh be convinced of thy nakedne≈øs without Chri≈øts righteou≈øne≈øs, and thy emptine≈øs without his fulne≈øs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Labour to go out of <hi>your ≈øelves</hi> to <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> for grace and peace: Surely in the Lord, ≈øhall one ≈øay, I have righteou≈øne≈øs and ≈øtrength; I, there it is to be found. Labour for a thir≈øty frame of ≈øoul, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes run far to ≈øuch, <hi>That he will fill the hungry with good things:</hi> go to Chri≈øt, ≈øoul, beg, pray, never leave God till he hath given thee an intere≈øt in Chri≈øt, <hi>for none can come to me, except the Father draw him:</hi> there is no pardon for the lea≈øt ≈øin out of Chri≈øt, but there is pardon for the greate≈øt ≈øin in Chri≈øt; one ≈øin can damn the ≈øoul out of Chri≈øt, but no ≈øin can hurt the ≈øoul in Chri≈øt. Oh go to Chri≈øt, ≈øoul, never give re≈øt to thy eyes, nor ≈ølumber to thy lids, till thou ha≈øt made peace with God in the bloud of Chri≈øt. One ≈øting of the fiery ≈øerpent was mortal, without looking upon the brazen Serpent; ≈øo one ≈øin will damn a ≈øoul out of Chri≈øt, but no ≈øin can damn a ≈øoul in Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To ≈øuch as have grace, but no ≈øence of peace, this is the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øel I would leave with all ≈øuch, <hi>Be much in the exerci≈øe of grace: frame much, believe much, u≈øe grace much, for the exerci≈øe and improving of grace will produce peace.</hi> There are ten duties which are to be the <hi>≈øphere of grace</hi> in activity, and in performing of them we ≈øhall have peace:</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Make Religion your bu≈øine≈øs, the main de≈øign of your lives; be Chri≈øtians to purpo≈øe, be not only Chri≈øtians by the bye, but <hi>let your conver≈øation be as becometh the Go≈øpel of Chri≈øt,</hi> Phil. 1.27.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Put forth renewed <hi>Acts of Faith</hi> on Chri≈øt every day, and remember it is as much your duty to believe in Chri≈øt to day, as if you had never believed before. O live by faith every day, and this will bring peace to you.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Maintain a con≈øtant communion with God daily: this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God is mans chief good; the happine≈øs of a <hi>Child</hi> is in communion with his <hi>Father,</hi> and the happine≈øs of a wife is in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with her Husband, and this is the happine≈øs of a Believers ≈øoul, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb facs="tcp:62760:102"/>
               <hi>with God the Father,</hi> through <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> our <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Husband.</hi> The ≈øeed of peace, it's true, it is ≈øown in the ≈øoul in Union, but then it takes root downward, and brings forth fruit upward. Spiritual peace will never be obtained if communion with God be not maintained: that gives comfort in the mid≈øt of all ≈øorrows, and ≈øatisfies all doubts, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences all wants. Lo this is the fruit of communion with God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Be good at all times, but of all, be≈øt in bad times; many Chri≈øtians lo≈øe their peace, by remitting of their grace, and let loo≈øe the reins of Religion, to avoid the cen≈øures of a crooked generation. A <hi>Chri≈øtians zeal</hi> ≈øhould be like <hi>winter fire,</hi> that burns the hotte≈øt when the air is coole≈øt: or like the Lilly, that looketh beautiful though among thorns; ≈øo ≈øhould a child of God though among ≈øinners.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>In all conditions choo≈øe ≈øuffering rather than ≈øinning:</hi> If ever you would have peace, choo≈øe ≈øuffering rather than ≈øinning; he that values peace with God, or peace with con≈øcience, he mu≈øt make this his choice. <hi>Daniel</hi> rather cho≈øe to be ca≈øt to Lions than to lo≈øe the peace of his con≈øcience: the three Children cho≈øe rather to burn in the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, than to bow to the Image. One ≈øaid, <hi>He would rather go to Hell free from ≈øin, than to live in Heaven with guilt on his Con≈øcience.</hi> (My bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) let me a little enlarge, becau≈øe ≈øufferings may overtake us; for Per≈øecution is the <hi>genius</hi> of the Go≈øpel, therefore let me leave for ≈øhort Rules with you concerning ≈øufferings.</p>
            <p>See that your Cau≈øe be good, your Call be clear, your Spirit meek, and your End right. Sufferings cannot bring our peace without either of them, but with them all our ≈øufferings ≈øhall be peace.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Let your Cau≈øe be good: Its not the Bloud, but the Cau≈øe that makes a Martyr: it is not for every cau≈øe a Chri≈øtian ≈øhould engage to ≈øuffer: every cau≈øe will no more bear ≈øuffering, than every little ≈øtream will bear a ≈øhip: nor will Chri≈øt let go ≈øweetne≈øs to every ≈øuffering, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Let none of you ≈øuffer as a Murderer, or as a Thief, or as an Evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doer, or as a Bu≈øie-body in other mens matters.</hi> To ≈øuffer thus, is neither Chri≈øtian-like nor comfortable; ≈øome ≈øuffer rather as Malefactors than as Chri≈øts Martyrs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Let your Call be clear: It's not ami≈øs to have a good cau≈øe without a Call: ≈øome may ≈øuffer for the cau≈øe of God, and yet ≈øin in ≈øuffering for want of a Call. Chri≈øt calls not all to ≈øuffer; to ≈øome it is given, to others it is not: if thy Call be clear, thy Peace will be ≈øweet, though thy ≈øufferings be never ≈øo great. But you will ≈øay, how ≈øhall I know when I am called to ≈øuffer?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> 1. When Truth ≈øuffers by our ≈øilence, then are we called to ≈øuffer.?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:103"/>2. When our lives will be the denial of Chri≈øt, then are we called to deny our lives for Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When ≈øin and ≈øuffering ≈øurrounds us that we cannot get out, but we mu≈øt either run through ≈øin or ≈øuffering, then I may ≈øafely conclude, That Chri≈øt calleth me to ≈øuffer, and in this cau≈øe we may expect the peace and ≈øweetne≈øs of his pre≈øence.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The third direction for ≈øuffering is this, Our ≈øpirit mu≈øt be meek; ≈øo was Chri≈øt, he went as a <hi>Lamb to the ≈ølaughter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is po≈ø≈øible a man may be right in his cau≈øe, and yet ≈øinful in his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: and if ≈øo, no wonder if Chri≈øt be not ≈øweet to us. To be fierce, and raging, and reviling in ≈øuffering, it is not becoming humanity, and therefore much le≈øs like Chri≈øtianity. A Chri≈øtian ≈øhould be like Chri≈øt, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.41. <hi>And they departed from the pre≈øence of the Council, rejoycing that they were counted worthy to ≈øuffer ≈øhame for his Name..</hi> It becomes tho≈øe that are found in the ≈øpirit, to give ble≈ø≈øing for cur≈øing: the more of Chri≈øts ≈øpirit is in our ≈øufferings, the more comfort and joy we ≈øhall receive from our ≈øufferings.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, See that your End in ≈øuffering be right: If it be ≈øelf or ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, or ≈øchi≈øm, then Chri≈øt cannot be ≈øweet to thee. Some have died that their Ends may live. <hi>Socrates</hi> died in the defence of the Truth, and to prove that there is but one God, but whether he died for Honour, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plau≈øe, or for Gods ≈øake, I think it is not hard to determine. But let thy Cau≈øe be good, thy Call clear, thy Spirit meek, and thy End right, and then you ≈øhall have peace in all your ≈øufferings: that is the fifth thing. Choo≈øe ≈øufferings rather than ≈øinning.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, If you would have peace, be much in ≈øtudying the Scriptures: for as God is the God of Peace, and Chri≈øt the Prince of Peace, ≈øo the Go≈øpel is the Go≈øpel of Peace, which God hath given to thee to lead thee in the ways of peace, <hi>Great peace have they that love thy Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seventhly, Take heed of Apo≈øtacy, either in Doctrine or Principles: Though a Believer is freed from Apo≈øtacy in the ≈øtate of grace, yet he is not freed from Apo≈øtacy in the degrees of grace. He may fall ≈øinfully, though he cannot fall finally. <hi>Demas</hi> fell by one, St. <hi>Peter</hi> by the other. Pray with <hi>David. P≈øal.</hi> 17.5. <hi>Hold up my goings in thy paths, that,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Make the Word of God your rule in all things: be ≈øure you have a Scripture warrant for all your practi≈øes; but e≈øpecially keep clo≈øe to Scripture in matters of Gods wor≈øhip.</p>
            <p>There are endle≈øs di≈øcour≈øes about the Mode of Gods wor≈øhip; I have no di≈øputing time. It is good in difficult ca≈øes, always to take the ≈øure≈øt ≈øide: (for in≈øtance) if I follow the traditions of man for the wor≈øhip
<pb facs="tcp:62760:103"/>of God, I may; but if I keep clo≈øe to the directions of God in the Scripture, I am ≈øure I cannot ≈øin; for this is the ≈øure word of Prophecy, to which you do well to take heed, therefore in ≈øuch a doubltful ca≈øe, Gods will is, that we take the ≈øure≈øt ≈øide: go to the Law and to the Te≈øtimony: labour to be fruitful and grounded Chri≈øtians.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Keep up the power of Godline≈øs, do not let Religion down into a lifele≈øs formality: <hi>The righteous ≈øhall flouri≈øh like a Palm-tree: He ≈øhall grow like a Cedar in</hi> Lebanon, <hi>tho≈øe that be planted in the hou≈øe of the Lord, ≈øhall flouri≈øh in the Courts of our God,</hi> P≈øal. 92.12, 13. My Brethren, it is as much a duty in them that have grace, to improve it, as for them that have no grace to get it. If you ≈øit under the daily means, the daily waterings of God, and do not grow, do you think this will be peace in the latter end? ≈øurely no, (my Brethren) your fruitfulne≈øs under the Go≈øpel is of very great concernment. It's unfruitfulne≈øs that makes God lay his <hi>Vineyard wa≈øte.</hi> It's fruitfulne≈øs that procures the forwarding of your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in the day of grace.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, Ob≈øerve that excellent rule of the Apo≈øtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Finally, brethren, what≈øoever things are true, what≈øoever things are hone≈øt, what≈øoever things are ju≈øt, what≈øoever things are pure, what≈øoever things are lovely, what≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things are of good report, if there be any vertue, and if there any prai≈øe, think on the≈øe things.</hi> And now, my Brethren, I commend you to God, and to the <hi>Word of God,</hi> that is infinitely able to make you wi≈øe to ≈øalvation, with this Benediction which I ≈øhall make my Valediction, <hi>Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and from our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi>

               <bibl>

               </bibl>
               <q>The righteous peri≈øheth, and no man layeth it to heart, and merciful men are taken away, none con≈øidering that the righteous are taken away from the evil to come.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WE are here met this Evening to perform the la≈øt office of Love for an eminent and ancient ≈øervant of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Mini≈øter of the Go≈øpel, Mr. <hi>Simeon A≈øh,</hi> one who hath formerly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed this office for many other Mini≈øters, and now we are met to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this office for him; and it is not long before others will meet to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the ≈øame office for us, ≈øo frail, ≈øo brittle, and ≈øo uncertain is the life of man.</p>
            <p>Now the Text that I have cho≈øen, is ≈øuitable for this occa≈øion; for this Reverend Mini≈øter was fir≈øt a righteous man, he was righteous in an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va gelical ≈øen≈øe, he was one that was ju≈øtified and ≈øanctified. Secondly,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:104"/>he was a merciful man both in active and pa≈ø≈øive ≈øen≈øe; he was one that ≈øhewed mercy to the di≈øtre≈ø≈øed Members of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and he was one to whom God ≈øhewed mercy; this righteous and merciful man is now peri≈øhed, as to his outward condition, not as to his everla≈øting condition: but as to his outward bodily condition, he is peri≈øhed, and he is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: the word in the Hebrew is very emphatical; <hi>merciful men, Colligun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> are gathered; it is the ≈øame word that is u≈øed concerning <hi>Jo≈øiah</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 22.10. <hi>Thou ≈øhalt be gathered to thy Fathers, and go to thy grave in peace, and ≈øhalt not ≈øee the evil that I will bring upon this Nation.</hi> This godly and righteous man is now gathered, as ripe Corn into the Barn of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; he is taken away from the evil that is to come, from beholding that evil that is to come upon this ≈øinful world, he is taken away in mercy, that he may not be troubled with the troubles that are comming upon many; he is taken away from the evil to come.</p>
            <p>And thus you ≈øee how ≈øuitable the Text is to the occa≈øion; there is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one particular that I de≈øire may prove un≈øuitable; <hi>for the righteous and merciful man,</hi> ≈øaith the Text, <hi>peri≈øheth, and no man con≈øiders, nor layes it to heart:</hi> The≈øe words are <hi>verba commentantis, &amp; objurgantis,</hi> the words of the Prophet bemoaning the ≈øpiritual ≈øecurity of the people of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and reproving them for their ≈øpiritual Lethargy: Now I de≈øire that this part may not prove ≈øutable, but that all of you may lay to heart the death of this ancient, merciful and righteous man.</p>
            <p>The Ob≈øervations from the words, are the≈øe ≈øix.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Fir≈øt, <hi>That the righteous man mu≈øt peri≈øh as well as the unrighteous.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Secondly, <hi>That the peri≈øhing of a righteous man, is nothing but his gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, Chri≈øt, and the ble≈ø≈øed company of Saints and Angels.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Thirdly, <hi>A righteous man as long as he lives, is the pre≈øervative of a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the ≈øupporter of a Kingdom, the Chariots and Hor≈øe-men of a Nation.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Fourthly, <hi>The death of a righteous man is a warning-piece from Heaven, a Beacon ≈øet on ≈øire to give notice of evil approaching.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Fifthly, <hi>That God doth on purpo≈øe take away righteous men, that they might not ≈øee the evil that is coming on a Nation.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Sixthly, <hi>That it is a great and common ≈øin, not to con≈øider and lay to heart the death of a righteous man.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. It is a common fin, and therefore it is ≈øet down in the greate≈øt lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, <hi>the righteous peri≈øheth, and no man layeth it to heart;</hi> that is, very few: <hi>And merciful men are taken away, no man con≈øidering;</hi> that is, very few.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a great ≈øin, and therefore the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> in the former Chapter calls to all the bea≈øts of the field to devour, that is, all the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Church to de≈øtroy the Children of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> becau≈øe they drank
<pb facs="tcp:62760:104"/>≈øtrong drink, filling them≈øelves with merriment, and promi≈øed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves happy dayes, but did not con≈øider that <hi>the righteous were taken away from the evil to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He begin with the fir≈øt, <hi>that the righteous peri≈øh as well as the unrighteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How is it that the righteous peri≈øh? not in their ≈øoul, they cannot pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øh ≈øo: nay, the truth is, they cannot peri≈øh properly in their bodies; for the bodies of the Saints never totally and finally peri≈øh; for the very du≈øt of the Saints in the grave, is precious in Gods ≈øight, and they are a≈øleep in Je≈øus, and by the power of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, they ≈øhall be rai≈øed glorious bodies: Nothing peri≈øheth of a righteous man by death totally &amp; finally, but ≈øin: and therefore the meaning of the word is as <hi>Mu≈øculus</hi> and <hi>Ju≈øtin</hi> Martyr ob≈øerve, <hi>perit,</hi> peri≈øheth; that is not according to the truth of the thing, but according to the opinion of the world, and the proper lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of his expre≈ø≈øion is this, <hi>the righteous peri≈øheth;</hi> that is, the righteous mu≈øt dye, and go down to the hou≈øe of rottenne≈øs as well as others, and that up upon a fore-fold account.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> Becau≈øe the righteous are included within the ≈øtatute of death as well as the unrighteous; <hi>≈øtatutum e≈øt: Heb.</hi> 9.27. <hi>It is appointed for all men ance to dye,</hi> the righteous as well as the unrighteous; it is true, Je≈øus Chri≈øt hath taken away the hurt of death, but not death it ≈øelf: Je≈øus Chri≈øt hath di≈øarmed death, made death like the Viper that fa≈øtened upon <hi>Pauls</hi> hand, but did not hurt him; he hath made it like the brazen Serpent that hath no ≈øting, but a healing power in it: Chri≈øt hath ≈øanctified death, conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ≈øweetned death: at the pre≈øent we are all under the ≈øtatute of death, but at la≈øt this enemy ≈øhall be de≈øtroyed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The righteous con≈øi≈øt of peri≈øhing principles as well as the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous: the righteous are earthly ve≈ø≈øels made of du≈øt, I, their foundation is in the du≈øt; their lives are a vapour as well as the lives of the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous:</p>
            <p n="3">3. The righteous mu≈øt dye as well as others, becau≈øe they have a body of ≈øin which they carry about them; for there is no man ≈øo wi≈øe, that lives and ≈øins not, <hi>Eccle≈ø.</hi> 7.10. wherefore there is that which de≈øerves death in a righteous man.</p>
            <p>La≈øtly, and e≈øpecially, The righteous peri≈øh upon a peculiar account: <hi>For if we have hope only in this life</hi> (≈øaith the Apo≈øtle) <hi>we are of all men mo≈øt mi≈øerable,</hi> and therefore they mu≈øt peri≈øh to keep them from peri≈øhing: they mu≈øt ≈øay as <hi>Themi≈øtocles, Peri≈ø≈øem ni≈øi perii≈ø≈øem,</hi> they mu≈øt dye that they may re≈øt from their labour: for here is not our re≈øt, <hi>Mich.</hi> 2.10. there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth a re≈øt for the people of God: there is no re≈øt in this world: the word <hi>quies</hi> wants the plural number.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:105"/>2. The righteous mu≈øt die that they may have their reward, their crown of glory, that God hath laid up for them, they mu≈øt fir≈øt fight the good fight, and fini≈øh their cour≈øe, and then they ≈øhall receive a crown of glory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They mu≈øt dye, that they may be free from ≈øin; for they ≈øhall never put off the body of ≈øin, till they put off the body of the fle≈øh.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They mu≈øt dye, that mortality may be ≈øwallowed up of life, that corruption may put on incorruption.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They mu≈øt dye, that they may be perfect in grace.</p>
            <p>La≈øtly, They mu≈øt dye, that they may ≈øee God face to face, and be for ever with the Lord, which they cannot do till they dye: therefore ble≈ø≈øed by God that the righteous mu≈øt peri≈øh. If a man ≈øhould always live on earth, always be young, rich, and healthful, it would be unwelcome news, for while we are in the body, we are ab≈øent from the Lord, and ≈øubject to ≈øin; and therefore when <hi>Peter</hi> asked Chri≈øt what ≈øhould be done with <hi>John,</hi> Chri≈øt tells him, <hi>If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?</hi> from henceforth there went a report abroad that <hi>John</hi> ≈øhould not dye; Now the Apo≈øtle him≈øelf was much di≈øplea≈øed with this report, and looked upon it as a great affliction that he ≈øhould not dye, and therefore he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf confutes it; <hi>But yet Je≈øus</hi> (≈øaid he) <hi>≈øaid not that he ≈øhould not dye;</hi> as if he had ≈øaid, God forbid that I ≈øhould not dye.</p>
            <p>Before I come to Application of this point, give me leave to ≈øpeak ≈øom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the ≈øecond point, and ≈øo I ≈øhall apply them both together.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond Doctrine is this, <hi>That the peri≈øhing of a righteous man, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a gathering him to God, Chri≈øt, and the ble≈ø≈øed ≈øociety of Saints and Angels in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is contained in the ≈øecond expre≈ø≈øion, <hi>merciful men are taken away;</hi> the word in the Hebrew is <hi>Colliguntur,</hi> they are gathered; it is evegetical of the former, they did not peri≈øh, but they are gathered to God and Chri≈øt: there is a great deal of excellency, and a Magazine of ≈øweetne≈øs in this expre≈ø≈øion, <hi>They are gathered.</hi> It implies two things.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, That the righteous are in a ≈øcattered condition while they are in this world, and that three ways.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. They are ≈øcattered among the wicked and ungodly of the world, as ≈øheep among wolves, as lambs among Lyons, rent and torn in pieces, forced to wander up and down in Sheep skins and Goats skins.</item>
               <item>2. The righteous are ≈øcattered in the world one from another, and that two ways.
<list>
                     <item>1. They are ≈øcattered by their different habirations, for the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are forced one from another, as <hi>Lot</hi> from <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. They are ≈øcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered one from another by the cruel per≈øecution of wicked men; and therefore you read <hi>Acts</hi> 8. that at that time when there was a per≈øecution
<pb facs="tcp:62760:105"/>again≈øt the Church at <hi>Jeru≈øalem, that they were all ≈øcattered abroad.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </item>
               <item>3. The godly are ≈øcattered in this life from the glorious pre≈øence of God in Heaven, indeed they are never ≈øcattered from the gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of God, but ≈øometimes they are ≈øcattered from the comfortable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of God; as long as we live in the world, we ≈øhall be ≈øcattered from the glorious pre≈øence of God: for while we are in the body, we are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent from the Lord.</item>

            <p>Secondly, This implies a bringing of Gods people out of this ≈øcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed condition; it is a gathering of the Righteous out of this world into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, from a ≈øinful per≈øecuted world, into a ≈øinle≈øs glorious world; from diver≈øity of dwellings on earth, to dwell altogether in one Heaven; it is a gathering out of the reach of Men and Devils, and a gathering them not only to the gracious, but to the glorious pre≈øence of God and Chri≈øt, and to the ≈øouls of ju≈øt men made perfect, and to the general a≈ø≈øembly of the fir≈øt born, and to the City of the living God, the Heavenly <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> where they ≈øhall live together, never to be ≈øcattered again. To under≈øtand this the better, let me offer three things to you, ≈øhewing you that the Godly are gathered to God three ways: in this life, at death, and at the day of Judgment.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, The Righteous are gathered to God in this life, and that is at their fir≈øt conver≈øion, for by nature we are Aliens and ≈øtrangers to God, ≈øcattered from any union or communion with God, not only ≈øcattered from the glorious, but from the gracious pre≈øence of God. God made men, at fir≈øt to enjoy communion with him≈øelf, but <hi>Adam</hi> lo≈øt this by ≈øin, and now we are all <hi>Cains</hi> and vagabonds, ≈øcattered from the love of God, and from union and communion with God; but when God converts any of the Elect, he gathers them home to him≈øelf; for conver≈øion is nothing but Gods gathering them to him≈øelf in the ≈øecond <hi>Adam,</hi> that were ≈øcattered from him in the fir≈øt <hi>Adam:</hi> the fir≈øt <hi>Adam</hi> was a Root of ≈øcattering, a Root of ≈øeparation from God; but the ≈øecond <hi>Adam</hi> was a Root of union and conjunction. Chri≈øt is the head, and the Elect are all gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in him, that he might gather together in one all things in Chri≈øt, ≈øo that conver≈øion is nothing but a gathering of the Elect of God, to Chri≈øt by faith, and a gathering to one another by love and charity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Gods people are gathered at death: here they are gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Chri≈øt by Grace, but at death they are gathered to Chri≈øt in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; here they are gathered to God by hope, but at death by fruition: here Chri≈øt is gathered to us, he comes down and dwells with us; but at death, we ≈øhall be gathered to him, we ≈øhall go up and be joyned with him. There's a great deal of difference between <hi>e≈ø≈øe cum Chri≈øto,</hi> and <hi>e≈ø≈øe in
<pb facs="tcp:62760:106"/>Chri≈øto: e≈ø≈øe cum Chri≈øto,</hi> to be one with Chri≈øt is a <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> great ≈øecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but <hi>e≈ø≈øe in Chri≈øto,</hi> to be one in Chri≈øt, it is a Chri≈øtians great felicity; in this life we are gathered to God by Faith, but at death by vi≈øion.</p>
            <p>La≈øtly, We ≈øhall be gathered to God at the day of judgment, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the day of the gathering of the Saints together: a day when all the Saints that are, have been, or ≈øhall be, ≈øhall be gathered together, 2 <hi>The≈ø.</hi> 2.1. I be≈øeech you brethren, by the coming of our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and by our gathering together unto him at the great day: At the day of Judgment we ≈øhall all be gathered together, and ≈øhall all be taken up to Heaven? I mean all the righteous, and be ever with the Lord: and ≈øo much for the opening of the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>But here it may be objected; Are not the unrighteous gathered by death as well as the righteous?</p>
            <p>I an≈øwer, it is true, the unrighteous are ≈øcattered in this life, and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by death, as well as the righteous, but with a great deal of difference.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, the wicked are ≈øcattered in this life, but they are ≈øcattered from God; but the Godly are ≈øcattered for God, and for a good con≈øcience ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, as they at <hi>Jeru≈øalem</hi> were ≈øcattered: The godly are ≈øcattered from the glorious pre≈øence of God in Heaven; but the wicked are ≈øcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from the gracious pre≈øence of God on earth. Again, the ≈øcattering of the wicked is a cur≈øe to them, and it is threatned as a cur≈øe, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.32. I will ≈øcatter you among the Heathen, and draw out my ≈øword after you: and where-ever the wicked come, in what part ≈øoever of the world the wicked are ≈øcattered, they bring the cur≈øe of God with them: and they bring the judgments of God on Towns and Cities where they are, as plague, famine, and ≈øword, and all mi≈øeries. But the Godly, when they are ≈øcattered, they are ≈øcattered as a ble≈ø≈øing, into what country or town ≈øoever they come, they come as a ble≈ø≈øing, they come like a Ship laden with Corn, to a Town ready to peri≈øh with famine: they come as a ble≈ø≈øing four ways.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Fir≈øt, they pray down a ble≈ø≈øing on the place where they come.</item>
               <item>Secondly, they come as a ble≈ø≈øing by their holy life and conver≈øation, that is a Load-≈øtone to draw others to holine≈øs.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, they come as a ble≈ø≈øing, by their holy advice and coun≈øel that they give to the place where they come.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Nay fourthly, their very pre≈øence is a ble≈ø≈øing; as long as <hi>Lot</hi> was in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Sodom</hi> could not be de≈øtroyed; ≈øo long as <hi>Paul</hi> was in the ≈øhip, the 300 could not be drowned. So that the godly come as a ble≈ø≈øing wherever they are ≈øcattered, but the wicked are as chaff ≈øcattered by the wind, and they are ≈øcattered as the du≈øt of the earth: You know when the du≈øt is ≈øcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:106"/>it gets into mens eyes and blinds them; and falls upon their cloaths, and ≈øullies them; ≈øo the wicked, wherever they are ≈øcattered, they defile the place where they are ≈øcattered. The godly are as Planets, that wander &amp; move from one part of Heaven to another, carrying light to the world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as the wicked are ≈øcattered while they live, ≈øo when they die, they are gathered; it is true, but how? not to God, and Chri≈øt, and his Angels; but they are gathered to the Devil and his Angels, and to damned ≈øpirits: not as bundles of Wheat in the Barn of Heaven, but as bundles of Tares to be burned for ever in everla≈øting fire.</p>
            <p>Now, if the righteous peri≈øh as well as others, and if their peri≈øhing be nothing but a gathering to God and Chri≈øt, then,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, learn hence the preciou≈øne≈øs of every righteous man, the great God will not gather things of no value; great men do not u≈øe to gather chaff and ≈øtraw; and therefore, when Chri≈øt ≈øaid of <hi>Jo≈øiah,</hi> I will gather thee to thy Fathers, it was a ≈øign he was a precious Pearl worth the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and of a high value and account in the ≈øight of God, and ≈øo is every true Child of God, right dear and precious are they in the ≈øight of God, both living, and dying; they are bought with a great price, not with Gold and Silver, and other corruptible things, but they are bought with the precious blood of the Son of God: they are as precious to God as thee Apple of his eye: ≈øo precious that he hath given Chri≈øt for them, and to them; ≈øo precious that he called them his Jewels, his peculiar trea≈øure, his <hi>Jedidiahs,</hi> and therefore God will not ≈øuffer them to peri≈øh, but gather them to him≈øelf before the evil day come, as the Husbandman gathers in the Corn, before the Bea≈øt go out into the field.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Learn hear what rea≈øon we have to be comforted in the death of a righteous man or woman, becau≈øe their death is not a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhing, but a gathering to God and Chri≈øt, and the ≈øociety of Saints and Angels. The death of a righteous man is no more than if a Merchant that hath abundance of Jewels in a far Countrey, he ≈øhould ≈øend for the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> home. Why death to a righteous man is nothing but God ≈øending for his Jewels home. Such a phra≈øe there is in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17. <hi>In the day that I make up my Jewels, they ≈øhall be mine.</hi> In this life they are imperfect Jewels; they are like Gold in the Oare mingled with a great deal of dro≈øs; and death is nothing but a perfection of the Jewels; death is nothing more; and God doth nothing by death, but as a Gold-≈øiner gathers up all his ends of Gold and Silver; it is nothing but ju≈øt as if a Father ≈øhould ≈øend for his Son home, that had been a long time ab≈øent from him, to his own hou≈øe: it is a carrying us to our Fathers hou≈øe. And therefore let us be comforted when our Righteous Friends dye, though their death be
<pb facs="tcp:62760:107"/>matter of ≈øorrow to us, in regard of the lo≈øs, that we ≈øu≈øtain by their death, and becau≈øe their death is a warning-piece of evil to come: yet in regard of them we have no cau≈øe to mourn. I ≈øpeak this of tho≈øe that are related to the righteous, when they dye; did you ever here of a Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that mourned for the carrying in of his Corn into the Barn? or a Jeweller mourn for making up of his Jewels? Let us mourn rather that we are le≈øt ≈øcattered among the wicked of the earth, and from the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pre≈øence of God and Chri≈øt: and let us morn for tho≈øe that are ≈øcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from Chri≈øt, and from grace: and for tho≈øe that whil≈øt they live are ≈øcattered, and when they dye are gathered to the Devil and his Angels. Let us not mourn for tho≈øe that dye in Chri≈øt, but let us mourn for tho≈øe that live out of Chri≈øt; let us not mourn over the body the ≈øoul hath left, but let us mourn over the ≈øoul God hath left.</p>
            <p>The third u≈øe is of Con≈øolation to all the people of God, in reference to evil times that are coming upon us, or to the evil of times. Whatever befalls a Child of God in this life, though he be ≈øcattered by wicked men, from <hi>England</hi> into forreign Countries, though he wanders up and down in De≈øarts and Wilderne≈ø≈øes, though he be ≈øcattered from hou≈øe to pri≈øon, yet there ≈øhall be a gathering time ≈øhortly: there will a time come when all the Saints ≈øhall be gathered to Chri≈øt, and to one another, never to part any more. The death of Gods people is not a peri≈øhing, but a gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: comfort your ≈øelves therefore with the≈øe words again≈øt the fear of death: look upon death as a gathering, as a gathering to Chri≈øt: you are here as <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lyons Den, as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in the dungeon; yet there will come a gathering, and if you dye in a good cau≈øe, you ≈øhall not peri≈øh, but be gathered to Chri≈øt, to his Saints and Angels.</p>
            <p>But you will ≈øay, If I were ≈øure when I dye, that I ≈øhould be gathered to Chri≈øt, to live for ever with him, this would be matter of great con≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to me: but you told me, the wicked are gathered by death, as well as the Godly: how ≈øhall I know whether (when I come to dye) I ≈øhall be gathered to the Devil and his Angels, or to Chri≈øt and his Angels? How ≈øhall I know whether I ≈øhall be gathered at death, as a bundle of tears to be burned in Hell, or a bundle of Wheat to be carryed up into the Barn of Heaven?</p>
            <p>I an≈øwer, You may know it by four things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. If you are righteous, then you ≈øhall be gathered to Chri≈øt at death; <hi>For the Righteous ≈øhall go into everla≈øting life:</hi> Heaven is entailed upon righteous men; by Righteou≈øne≈øs I mean the imputed Righteou≈øne≈øs, and imparted Righteou≈øne≈øs of Je≈øus Chri≈øt: I wave the explication of them, becau≈øe time will not give leave. <hi>Know you not</hi> (≈øaith the Apo≈øtle) <hi>that no
<pb facs="tcp:62760:107"/>unrighteous man ≈øhall inherit the Kingdom of God?</hi> Damnation is entail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon unrighteous men.</item>
               <item>2. If you are merciful, you ≈øhall be gathered to Chri≈øt: if you are one that is full of bowels of compa≈ø≈øion to the di≈øtre≈ø≈øed members of Chri≈øt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus, for Chri≈øt hath ≈øaid it, <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed are the merciful, for they ≈øhall obtain mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> now if you are hard-hearted, covetous, worldly minded, remember that Text, <hi>He ≈øhall have judgement without mercy, that ≈øhews no mercy.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. He that is gathered to the ≈øecond <hi>Adam</hi> by faith in this world, ≈øhall certainly be gathered unto Chri≈øt by vi≈øion in the other world; <hi>Chri≈øt Je≈øus</hi> will ≈øave all his members, and you mu≈øt know that faith is a tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting grace, it is not only a heart-purifying, but a world-overcoming grace: It takes a man out of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> and puts him into a new <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam;</hi> it takes a man out of the root of ≈øcattering, and puts him into the root of union and conjunction: Wherefore you that are now joyned to Chri≈øt by faith here, ≈øhall be joyned to Chri≈øt in glory hereafter. But now, you that are vagabonds, <hi>Cains,</hi> and aliens from the life of God, and from the life of grace: You that are wooden members, wooden legs in Chri≈øts body, that have no real conjunction with Chri≈øt, you ≈øhall not be gathered to him in glory.</item>
            </list>
            <p>La≈øtly, If you are gathered here to the Saints by love, then you ≈øhall be gathered to the Saints in Heaven, and to the everla≈øting injoyment of God with them to all eternity. Confider this, every man ≈øhall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered (when he dies) to tho≈øe whom he delights, and choo≈øeth to keep pany with while he lives in this world. If you are gathered to the wicked in love and affection here, you ≈øhall be gathered to them at death in hell and de≈øtruction, for it is pity companions ≈øhould be parted, wheat mu≈øt to wheat, and tares to tares, for wheat and tares ≈øhall not be bound to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at the la≈øt day.</p>
            <p>The la≈øt u≈øe is of exhortation: If the righteous mu≈øt peri≈øh, and if their death be nothing but a gathering, then take this threefold Exhortation.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Let us labor to make the be≈øt u≈øe we can of our godly friends and Mini≈øters before they be gathered; let us do as <hi>Eli≈øha</hi> did, he was told that his Ma≈øter <hi>Elijah</hi> was to be taken up to Heaven, and therefore he would never leave him till he had got the ≈øpirit of <hi>Elijah</hi> doubled upon him: If <hi>Eli≈øha</hi> had not thought that <hi>Elijah</hi> would have been taken up that day, he would never have followed him ≈øo punctually and in≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably as he did. O beloved! did you believe that Text, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.5. of which we have often had experience, <hi>Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?</hi> Indeed if they did live for ever, we might get good from them when we plea≈øe, becau≈øe we are ≈øure never to lo≈øe
<pb facs="tcp:62760:108"/>them; but they live not for ever, but mu≈øt peri≈øh, and be taken up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: And therefore whil≈øt we have them, let us make what u≈øe we can of them, before they be taken away from us. It is a great fault among the people of God, that they make no more u≈øe of their Godly friends and Mini≈øters. I have known many that have godly relations that have died, that it hath been the greate≈øt burden on their con≈øciences, that they got no more good by tho≈øe Godly Relations while they lived. Many of us deal with our Mini≈øters, as we do with a ≈øtrange ≈øight that is to be ≈øeen near our doors; we are not ≈øo much ≈øolicitous when we ≈øee it, but a ≈øtranger that comes from a far Country, is curious, and very careful pre≈øently to ≈øee it. So do we in this City e≈øpecially; I have had experience of it by being here many years; ≈øtrangers that come out of the Country, many times get that good by a Mini≈øter, that his own people do not, becau≈øe they think their Mini≈øter is continually with them: but a ≈øtranger knows he is there but for a day, and he hears ≈øo, that he carries Chri≈øt home with him, and a great deal of con≈øolation al≈øo. Beloved, this is a great fault; I be≈øeech you remember, the Righteous mu≈øt be gathered: let us therefore do with them as we do with Books that are borrowed: if a man borrows a Book, he knows he mu≈øt keep it but for a day or two, and therefore he will be ≈øure to read it over, whereas if the Book be a mans own, he laies it a≈øide, becau≈øe he knows he can read it at any time. Remember, your Mini≈øters are but lent you, they are not your own, and you know not but that God may take away your <hi>El<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>jahs</hi> from you this night: Therefore make what u≈øe you can of them, while you have them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Mu≈øt the Righteous be taken away? Then let the Righteous make con≈øcience of doing what good they can before they are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Beloved, if it were po≈ø≈øible for the Godly to grieve in Heaven, this would be their greate≈øt ≈øorrow, that they have done God no more ≈øervice here upon earth. Be wi≈øe for God, O ye Righteous! do as old men that have rich places &amp; offices, they labour to buy the rever≈øion of their places for their Children: So mu≈øt you to whom God hath given great gifts and graces, labor to propagate your gifts &amp; graces, that there may be no lo≈øs by your death. Ob≈øerve the cares of St. <hi>Paul</hi> the aged in his exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.4, 5, <hi>Watch thou all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an Evangeli≈øt, make full proof of thy Mini≈øtry,</hi> why ≈øo? <hi>for I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore work thou, ≈øee that thou endure affliction, preach the Go≈øpel as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Mini≈øter of the Go≈øpel, that there may be no lo≈øs by my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2. <hi>The things that thou ha≈øt heard of me among many witne≈ø≈øes, the ≈øame commit thou to faithful men that ≈øhall be able to teach others
<pb facs="tcp:62760:108"/>al≈øo.</hi> Hath God committed any thing to you, a trea≈øure of Learning or Grace? commit it to young Mini≈øters that they may commit it to others, that ≈øo there may be a ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of Gifts and Graces: Do as Phy≈øitians do, that labour to communicate their skill to their Children, and to others; ≈øo ≈øhould we, that there may be a ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of Godly ones, that Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs may be entailed upon us, and our Relations.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and la≈øtly, let us all labour to be ≈øuch, that when we dye, when we come to be gathered, we may be gathered to Chri≈øt and his Angels; not to the Devil and his angels; And for that purpo≈øe let us labour to be merciful and righteous, and let us be gathered to Chri≈øt by Faith, and to one another by love and dear affection: and then we ≈øhall be gathered at the great day to Chri≈øt, and the ble≈ø≈øed company of the Saints &amp; Angels.</p>
            <p>There are 4 ob≈øervations yet behind, but I mu≈øt wave them at this time.</p>
            <p>I have now another Sermon to preach, and I cannot without injury to you that are alive, and without wrong to the memory of my dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Brother, but ≈øpeak ≈øomething of him, at who≈øe Funeral we are met this Evening, not ≈øo much for his commendation, he needs not, but for our imitation; it is pity, great pity ≈øomething ≈øhould not be ≈øaid, that this Reverend Mini≈øter, though dead, may yet preach this night; and I have ≈øo much to ≈øay of him, that I know not where to begin, and when I have begun, I hardly know how to make an end: I mu≈øt confe≈øs, the little time alloted me for the providing this ≈øolemn work, and the nece≈ø≈øary avoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this little time, have hindred me from enforming my ≈øelf about his Breeding and manner of Education at <hi>Emanuel</hi> Colledge, under Mr. <hi>Steaker,</hi> and his excellent carriage and conver≈øe with Mr. <hi>Hilder≈øham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> Mr. <hi>Langly,</hi> and other Mini≈øters famous in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations; and the many pre≈ø≈øures and hard≈øhips that he ≈øuffered in tho≈øe parts and times, for the keeping of his con≈øcience pure from that which he counted ≈øin, and therefore I mu≈øt draw a vail over that part of his life, and confine my di≈øcour≈øe only to the time ≈øince his coming to live with us in <hi>London,</hi> which is about the ≈øpace of twenty two, or twenty three years, all which time I have had the happine≈øs to be intimately acquainted with him, in≈øomuch as that I can freely and clearly profe≈øs, and that with a ≈øad heart, that I, and many others, have lo≈øt a real, wi≈øe, and Godly friend, brother, and fellow-labourer in the Lord; the Church hath lo≈øt an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Member, and choice pillar; and this City hath lo≈øt an antient faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and painful Mini≈øter; who by his Prayers and Holy life, did ≈øeek to keep off the judgements of God from falling on us; and the le≈øs ≈øen≈øible the City is of this lo≈øs, the greater is the lo≈øs. I fear we may too truly repeat the words in the Text, <hi>The righteouus peri≈øheth, and no man lays it to
<pb facs="tcp:62760:109"/>heart: and mereiful men are taken away, none con≈øidering that the righteous are taken away from the evil to come.</hi> I have read of <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew, and by chance met with the ≈øame in the life of St. <hi>Ambro≈øe,</hi> that when they came to any City or Town, and heard of the death of any Godly man, though never ≈øo poor, they would both of them mourn exceedingly, becau≈øe of the great lo≈øs that place had by the death of that Godly man, and becau≈øe it was a warning-piece from God of evil approaching. But we have had many Godly men, and Godly Mini≈øters taken away of late, and yet I fear me, but few lay it to heart; and therefore as I ≈øaid, the lo≈øs is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to this City, becau≈øe it is ≈øo little ≈øen≈øible of it. It is a great lo≈øs al≈øo to his relations; his Wife hath lo≈øt a dear and loving Husband, his Si≈øter a brother, his Pari≈øh and Congregation a faithful Pa≈øtor.</p>
            <p>The Mini≈øterial excellencies of many Mini≈øters were collected and concentred in one <hi>Simeon A≈øh,</hi> he was a <hi>Bazalcel</hi> in Gods Tabernacle, a Ma≈øter-builder, an old Di≈øciple, a <hi>Polycarp,</hi> a Chri≈øtian of long ≈øtanding in the School of Chri≈øt, a burning and a ≈øhining light, one whom many Mini≈øters and other good Chri≈øtians called Father, in≈øomuch that it was a common proverb in this City, Father <hi>A≈øh;</hi> and I believe many experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally weep over him, as the King did over the Prophet <hi>Eli≈øha, My Father, my Father, the chariots of I≈ørael, and the hor≈øemen thereof!</hi> for he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved de≈øired, and died lamented; not only in the City, but I believe in many places in the Country where he was known. But more particulary, there were twelve excellencies I ob≈øerved in this reverend Mini≈øter, and my dear Brother, that were as 12 Jewels or precious Pearls in that Crown with which God had crowned him: I ≈øhall name them for your imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and benefit; He needs them not, for he is above our Eulogy.</p>
            <p>The fir≈øt and chief Jewel that did beautifie &amp; adorn this our Brother, was his ≈øincerity and uprightne≈øs in heart; which indeed is not a ≈øingle Grace, but the ≈øoul of all Grace, and the interlineary that mu≈øt run through all Grace; what is faith if it be not unfeigned? what will love to God profit you if it be not without di≈ø≈øimulation? what is repentance worth if it be not in truth? as the body without the ≈øoul is a rotten car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ka≈øs, ≈øo is all grace without ≈øincerity; this is the ≈øoul of all grace, this is the girdle of truth. Sincerity is that which girts all our ≈øpiritual armor to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and makes them u≈øeful: what advantage is it to have the brea≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate of Righteou≈øne≈øs, the ≈øhield of Faith, the helmet of Hope, if they be but painted things? it is the girdle of ≈øincerity that makes all the other parts of our armor u≈øeful. Now this excellent grace of ≈øincerity was eminent in our dear Brother; he was a true <hi>Nathaniel</hi> in whom there was no guile; I mean no allowed hypocri≈øie, this was that which carried
<pb facs="tcp:62760:109"/>him through the pangs of death with a great deal of comfort; for he was able to ≈øay with <hi>Hezekiah, Remember, O Lord, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart.</hi> He could ≈øay with <hi>Paul, this is my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, the te≈øtimony of my con≈øcience, that in ≈øimplicity and godly ≈øincerity, I have had my conver≈øation in this world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Another grace was his humilicy, this is a grace that he was cloathed withal, and it is a rare grace: for God dwells with the humble he re≈øi≈øts the proud; but he gives grace to the humble. This Reverend Mini≈øter was low in his own eyes, and therefore very high in Gods eyes; he had a mean e≈øteem of him≈øelf, and therefore he was high in e≈øteem with God. He was as <hi>Jacob</hi> ≈øaid of him≈øelf, <hi>le≈øs than the lea≈øt of Gods mercies,</hi> and therefore he was made partaker of the be≈øt of Gods mercies. He was like an ear of Corn full of fruit, bowing down in thankfulne≈øs to God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another Jewel was the fruitfulne≈øs of his di≈øcour≈øe; for it may be ≈øaid of him as it was of Chri≈øt, he went about doing good: where ever he went, he ≈øcattered his goodne≈øs, this all that knew him, knew to be true. He was full of good di≈øcour≈øe where ever he came; when I was with him in his ≈øickne≈øs, he took occa≈øion to complain much, and not without ju≈øt cau≈øe; (God grant his complaint may make impre≈ø≈øion upon our hearts) he complained that it was a great fault of Mini≈øters, that when they met together, they di≈øcour≈øed no more of Chri≈øt, of Heaven, and of the concernments of the other world, and profe≈ø≈øed that if GOD ≈øhould re≈øtore him, he would be more careful in his di≈øcour≈øe, and more fruitful than ever yet he had been.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another Jewel that beautified this Righteous man, was his merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne≈øs; he was a merciful man, which he manife≈øted not onely in his charity to the members of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, but in his frequent vi≈øiting of ≈øick per≈øons, and per≈øons that needed Spiritual phy≈øick. I know not any Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter in this City more careful in vi≈øiting the ≈øick than he was.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Another Jewel was his Prudence and Spiritual wi≈ødom; he was not onely a Pious and Godly, but a Wi≈øe and Prudent Mini≈øter: that had zeal for God, but knew how to mingle his zeal with di≈øcretion; di≈øcretion is nothing but frantick fury; di≈øcretion without zeal will quickly eat out the heart of Religion, and eat Religion out of the heart. Zeal without di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion is not a coal from the Altar, but a coal kindled by the wild-fire of pa≈ø≈øion, that is able to ≈øet a Nation on fire; but this Reverend Mini≈øter had zeal ≈øweetly tempered with di≈øcretion.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Another Jewel was his Patience; God was plea≈øed to exerci≈øe
<pb facs="tcp:62760:110"/>him with long and great afflictions, by rea≈øon of the Gout, that did often, e≈øpecially of late years, affix him to his bed, and afflict him with great pain; but God was plea≈øed to put his everla≈øting Arms underneath him, ≈øupporting him under all his pains, and giving him a great mea≈øure of patience, in≈øomuch, that in patience he did po≈ø≈øe≈øs his ≈øoul, and patience had its perfect work in him.</p>
            <p>The 7 Jewel was his high valuation of Je≈øus Chri≈øt; a written coppy for us to follow, and for you his people al≈øo. Being with him in his la≈øt ≈øickne≈ø≈øe, he exhorted me, and other Mini≈øters with him, to preach much of Je≈øus Chri≈øt; and to ≈øpeak to him of Je≈øus Chri≈øt; and he ≈øaid, <hi>When I con≈øider my be≈øt duties, I ≈øink, I dye, I de≈øpair; but when I think of Chri≈øt, I have enough, he is all, and in all.</hi> I think the≈øe were his very words. <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire</hi> (≈øaid he) <hi>to know nothing but Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and him Crucified: I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all things dung and dro≈øs, that I may be found in Chri≈øt:</hi> To this effect he ≈øpake in the morning before the evening in which he dyed, ≈øpeaking much of Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Another Jewel was, his diligence in preaching the Go≈øpel in ≈øea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, and out of ≈øea≈øon; in the time of his health he was a painful, labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Preacher; one that did not preach to tickle the ear, but to wound the heart; not to plea≈øe, but to profit; not ≈øeeking the applau≈øe of the People, but the ≈øalvation of their ≈øouls: This you all know to be true.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Jewel that did beautifie and adorn this Reverend Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter, was his excellent gift in Prayer; and herein he was very eminent, and did exceed many, nay I may ≈øay, mo≈øt of his Brethren: As <hi>Apolies</hi> was mighty in the Scriptures, ≈øo was he (as you all know) mighty in Prayer; he was a <hi>Jacob,</hi> very skilful in wre≈øtling with God; like <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> he often ≈øtood in the Gap, and at mo≈øt Fa≈øts, all the time of his health, he was a Mini≈øter that was cho≈øen to conclude with Prayer: and this heightens the lo≈øs that we ≈øu≈øtein by the death of this Godly Mini≈øter; becau≈øe we have lo≈øt the benefit of his Prayers, which is an invaluable lo≈ø≈øe; for though I doubt not but he prays in Heaven for the Church in general, yet I believe he prays not for any in particular; as not knowing what our condition is, <hi>For Abraham knows us not,</hi> for the Saints in Heaven know not what is done upon earth. The lo≈ø≈øe therefore is the greater, becau≈øe we have lo≈øt not only a preaching, but a praying Mini≈øter: And give me leave to add, that this excellency in this Mini≈øter is ≈øufficient to prove,
<list>
                  <item>1. That there is a gift of Prayer, which ≈øome again≈øt all rea≈øon do denie.</item>
                  <item>2. That conceived prayers, when uttered by one that hath the gift of prayer, are not vain tautologies, or empty repetitions, and a rate of non-≈øence, as ≈øome unju≈øtly charge men with, but they are the bleatings
<pb facs="tcp:62760:110"/>of Gods Spirit, that pierce not onely into the ears and hearts of the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but into the ears and heart of God him≈øelf.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. The next Jewel was, he had great acquaintance and communion with God; for he was of a long ≈øtanding in the School of Chri≈øt, and a good Proficient in that School. Much acquaintance he had with God, he was often in the Mount with God, and came down with his face ≈øhining, though he in his mode≈øty did not ≈øee it; and when he came to dye, he was able to ≈øay as Dr. <hi>Pre≈øton</hi> did when he lay a dying, <hi>I ≈øhall change my place, but not my company.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. Another Jewel was, his comfortable pa≈ø≈øage out of this world, dying with a great deal of calmne≈øs and ≈øerenity upon his Con≈øcience: The morning before he dyed, I heard him ≈øay the≈øe words. <hi>It is one thing to ≈øpeak of Chri≈øt, and of Heaven, and another thing to feel the con≈øolation of Chri≈øt, and of Heaven, as I do,</hi> clapping his hand on his brea≈øt. Another time I heard him ≈øay, <hi>The comforts of a holy Life are real, ≈øoul-≈øupporting; and that he felt the reality of tho≈øe comforts, and that by him we might know it was not in vain to ≈øerve God.</hi> And I cannot forget this ≈øpeech the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before he dyed, <hi>I am a little ≈øtraitened, but I care no more for my life than I do for this phillip.</hi> That which was ≈øaid of old <hi>Simeon, Luke</hi> 2. may be ≈øaid of this reverend Mr. <hi>Simeon A≈øh,</hi> who was a <hi>Simeon,</hi> a ju≈øt and devout man, an old ≈øervant of <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> one that waited for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolation of <hi>I≈ørael;</hi> one that dyed, though not with Chri≈øt in his bodily Arm, yet with Chri≈øt in the Arms of his faith; and when he dyed, could ≈øay, as it is there, <hi>Now Lord, lette≈øt thou thy ≈øervant depart in peace, for mine eyes have ≈øeen thy ≈øalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>La≈øtly, Another Jewel was his con≈øtancy and per≈øeverance; he was not a Reed ≈øhaken with every wind, but as firm as a Rock, an immoveable pillar in Gods hou≈øe, he was unchangeable in changeable times: in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion he was a hou≈øe built upon a Rock, not on the Sand; and as he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ≈øo he dyed holily, even as the ancient Patriarchs that dyed in the faith, and endured faithfully unto the death.</p>
            <p>Now this excellent Mini≈øter of Chri≈øt thus beautified with the≈øe Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, is now peri≈øhed as to his outward man, gathered to God, to Chri≈øt, and the ble≈ø≈øed company of Saints and Angels. The Application that I ≈øhall make of this di≈øcour≈øe, is this:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. To us Mini≈øters.</item>

            </list>
            <p>Fir≈øt, to us Mini≈øters. God hath of late years taken to him≈øelf many famous men: ≈øeven of the Lecturers of <hi>Cornhil</hi> are dead, Mr. <hi>Burroughs,</hi> Dr. <hi>Bolton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sedgwick.</hi> Mr, <hi>Whitakers,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cranford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Vines,</hi> and now Mr. <hi>A≈øh.</hi> I might name many other excellent Mini≈øters that are

                  </gap>uther</hi> a little before the wars in <hi>Germany</hi> began. The death of the Godly is like the ≈øeparating the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> from the Tents of <hi>Corah</hi> and his company, like the taking of <hi>Lot</hi> out of <hi>Sodom.</hi> When the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> departed from <hi>Corah</hi> and his company, the earth ≈øwallowed them up; and when <hi>Lot</hi> departed out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> God rained down fire and brim≈øtone upon them. Let the thoughts of the≈øe things cau≈øe us to provide our Arks, to get our <hi>Zoars.</hi> Let it teach young <hi>Samuels</hi> to ri≈øe up in the room of old <hi>Elies;</hi> young <hi>Eli≈øha's</hi> in the room of old <hi>Elijahs;</hi> and young <hi>Timothies</hi> in the room of <hi>Paul</hi> the aged; that there may be a ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of Go≈øpel-mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters to hold forth the Word of life to the Nation. And let us labour to be Inheritors of the Twelve Excellencies, that beautified this our Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Brother.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Let me ≈øpeak a few words to you of this Pari≈øh, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors of this worthy Mini≈øter. There is ≈øcarce one man of an hundred, that under≈øtands the tye and obligation that is betwixt a Mini≈øter and his People. Oh the Love and Affection that ought to be betwixt them! <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Galatians,</hi> that they could have plucked out their eyes for him if need were. <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtom</hi> tells us, that when <hi>Miletus</hi> was taken away by death from his People, their hearts ≈øunk with ≈øorrow; and ≈øuch love had they to him, that they called all their Children by his name, and got his picture engraven on their Rings. And I have read of <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtom,</hi> that when he was bani≈øhed from his People there was not a corner in the City, but was full of People weeping and lamenting. The lo≈øs of a Godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øter is a publick lo≈øs, and therefore there ought to be a publick mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: it is a ≈øoul lo≈øs, and therefore methinks every one of you ≈øhould weep and mourn; you have lo≈øt your common Father: you of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation have lo≈øt your ≈øpiritual Father, your ≈øpiritual Shepheard: you have lo≈øt your eyes, your guide: and indeed it is you that are his Flock, that mu≈øt commend your Mini≈øter by practi≈øing that which he preached; ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Do we again begin to commend our ≈øelves, or need we, as ≈øome others, Epi≈øtles of Commendations to you, or Letters of commendation from you? Ye are our Epi≈øtle written in our bearts, known and
<pb facs="tcp:62760:111"/>read all men.</hi> As if the Apo≈øtle ≈øhould ≈øay, do we need Letters of commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation? is it nece≈ø≈øary that we ≈øhould ≈øpend time in commending our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øtry? you are our Letters of commendation: your holine≈øs &amp; piety com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends a Mini≈øter above all other things. As when a man comes into an Orchard, or Vineyard, (≈øaith <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtom</hi>) and ≈øees every thing skilfully handled, and neatly trimmed, he need not ≈øpend time in commending the Vine-dre≈ø≈øer, or Carpenter, the work its ≈øelf commends them. So ought it to be among you. When we preach the Funeral Sermons of Mini≈øters, we mu≈øt look into the Pari≈øh or Congregation and ≈øee what Letters of commendation there are: whether the proficiency of the Auditors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their Mini≈øters, I grant, it is not always true: God doth not always give ≈øucee≈øs to a godly Mini≈øter, but the wor≈øt is yours, I had almo≈øt ≈øaid, the cur≈øe is yours: but I will ≈øpeak mode≈øtly, the wor≈øt is yours. Tell me, how many of you are able to ≈øay, I ble≈øs God that ever ≈øuch a Mini≈øter was ≈øent among us: ble≈ø≈øed be God that ever we heard him preach? what ≈øeal of his mini≈øtry is there here among you? he was in another, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place of this City, it may be here are people from all places that have been his Auditors, what ≈øeal of his Mini≈øtry is there now to be found among you? how many Souls hath he pluck'd out of the ≈ønares of the Devil? how many of you have gone weeping from a Sermon, knocking your brea≈øts, and pricked at the heart of ≈øin, crying out, <hi>Men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren what ≈øhall we do to be ≈øaved?</hi> your tears and mourning for ≈øin, the≈øe are the Auditors that commend your Mini≈øters. Go home now and think with your ≈øelves, what can I remember of all the Sermons that I have heard from Mr. <hi>A≈øh?</hi> and give me leave to tell you, woe be to you, if as your Mini≈øter be dead, ≈øo all the Sermons he made die with him: for as <hi>Abel</hi> being dead, yet ≈øpeaketh, ≈øo ≈øhall the Sermons of this worthy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter, at the great day, ≈øpeak for you, or again≈øt you: for they are ≈øpiritual Talents that God hath be-tru≈øted you with, and you mu≈øt be accountable: both he and you ≈øhall appear before the Tribunal of God; your Mini≈øter ≈øhall be examined, how he can free him≈øelf from the guilt of Soul-blood? and you ≈øhall be examined, what fruit you brought forth an≈øwerable to the means you have enjoyed? and if it appear you have been unprofitable and unfruitful hearers, Chri≈øt will ≈øay, <hi>Ca≈øt the unprofitable ≈øervants into ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter darkne≈øs.</hi> But I hope better things of you, and things that accompany ≈øalvation. What ever was good in this reverend Mini≈øter, let i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> live in you: and though he be dead, yet let not his Sermons that he preached die with you, but let them be in you: that at the great day, when he and you appear before God, he may be able to ≈øay, here am I, and the Children that thou ha≈øt given me.</p>

            <p>In which words, there are two things con≈øiderable.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The <hi>matter,</hi> of the Apo≈øtles Prayer.</item>
               <item>2. The <hi>grounds,</hi> which he doth in≈øinuate for Audience.</item>
            </list>
            <p>In the things he de≈øires, the <hi>Matter of the Prayer</hi> is laid down in <hi>v.</hi> 21 and is ≈øummarily and generally propounded in ≈øeveral expre≈ø≈øions; yet neverthele≈øs, ≈øo as they have their Specialities belonging to them. In the beginning he ≈øhews what he aims at, <hi>make you perfect,</hi> &amp;c. In general it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to their Sanctification, and that they be throughly ≈øanctified, as to their inward man, and outward conver≈øation, as to tho≈øe things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them, in the habits of their minds, and Eternal carriage.</p>
            <p>The Grounds which the Apo≈øtle u≈øes, by way of in≈øinuation for Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, are contained in the words of the 20. <hi>ver≈øe,</hi> wherein we have a very large de≈øcription of the Per≈øon prayed unto; <hi>The God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Je≈øus,</hi> &amp;c. He de≈øcribes him under ≈øuch notes and marks, as ≈øerve much for enlargment, and enforcement, in the matter of prayer.</p>
            <p>But here a Que≈øtion may ari≈øe; Seeing <hi>Grace</hi> is the thing the Apo≈øtle principally de≈øires, and 'tis u≈øual with holy men, both under the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Te≈øtament,</hi> to chu≈øe out ≈øuch <hi>Attributes,</hi> as ≈øure mo≈øt with their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular occa≈øions, and are mo≈øt agreeable to tho≈øe reque≈øts they have, why he doth not apply him≈øelf to God, as <hi>the God of all grace,</hi> but rather, <hi>the God of Peace?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therein fir≈øt, the Apo≈øtle ≈øeems to make u≈øe of that ≈øame liberty which belongs to holy men. As there is in the General, a <hi>Liberty</hi> left to Gods
<pb facs="tcp:62760:112"/>People from God him≈øelf: <hi>Paul</hi> in this place makes u≈øe of that liberty he had, as to the manner of prayer, u≈øing ≈øuch a de≈øcription of God, as ≈øeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good to him at pre≈øent. But ≈øecondly, if he be <hi>the God of Peace,</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, he is <hi>the God of Grace.</hi> If God hath glorified him≈øelf ≈øo far among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as to reconcile them to him≈øelf, by the blood of Chri≈øt, then there is no que≈øtion, God will proceed further; and having provided for tho≈øe things which appertain to their <hi>Ju≈øtification,</hi> no que≈øtion but he will for tho≈øe things that are nece≈ø≈øary to their <hi>Sanctification.</hi> Therefore, the Apo≈øtle argues plainly from <hi>Ju≈øtification,</hi> to <hi>Sanctification;</hi> He that <hi>ju≈øtifies</hi> his people through the <hi>Blood of Chri≈øt, Sanctifie</hi> you by the ≈øpirit of <hi>Chri≈øt, make you perfect to do his will, working in you that which is wel-plea≈øing in his ≈øight,</hi> &amp;c. So de≈øires we ≈øhould be <hi>Sanctified,</hi> on the con≈øideration of our <hi>Ju≈øtification;</hi> having provided for <hi>Ju≈øtification,</hi> by the blood of Chri≈øt, followes <hi>Sanctification</hi> by the <hi>≈øpirit of Chri≈øt,</hi> 1 <hi>The≈ø.</hi> 5.23. <hi>And the very God of peace ≈øanctifie you wholly,</hi> &amp;c. that God who is ally'd to you, <hi>the God of peace,</hi> and hath provided for you <hi>Peace,</hi> I de≈øire he would further provide <hi>Sanctification;</hi> for <hi>Sanctification</hi> is nothing el≈øe, but the effect of that grace, which is procured for Believers through the blood of Chri≈øt. There is no acce≈øs to God, for <hi>Sanctification of our Natures,</hi> until we prevail with him for the <hi>Ju≈øtification</hi> of our per≈øons, and he fir≈øt ≈øhews him≈øelf to be a <hi>God of peace,</hi> by way of <hi>Ju≈øtification,</hi> before a God of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Sanctification:</hi> But to proceed.</p>

            <p n="1">1. The Per≈øon to be taken notice of, is, our <hi>Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> That which we have con≈øiderable, is,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:113"/>Fir≈øt, The Title that belongs to him in his Church: in this regard, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Great Shepherd of his ≈øheep;</hi> The Shepherd of the ≈øheep, yea, the great Shepherd of the ≈øheep. What≈øoever glory was to be communicated to any Member of the Church, it was fir≈øt put into the head, before they were to be made partakers of it. Some were to be made inferior ranks, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.11. but it was not fit any ≈øhould have ≈øuch glory, to be called <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,</hi> before he had that honour of him. Therefore 'tis <hi>the Great Shepherd,</hi> he that is Shepherd not of a particular Congregation, but of the whole Church of God, he is the Saviour of all his body, he hath the full number of all the Elect, both among the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> committed to his charge to ≈øave.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What betides this great Shepherd, through Gods grace towards him, that is, <hi>that he is brought again from the dead,</hi> i. e. that he doth attain to a ≈øtate of Re≈øurrection, and here take notice of this by the way, for con≈øola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; The great Shepherd of the Sheep doth <hi>dye,</hi> but the great Shepherd of the Sheep <hi>ri≈øes</hi> again. Herein argues Gods love, that though he would ≈øuffer him to <hi>dye,</hi> yet not to <hi>≈øee corruption, P≈øal.</hi> 16.10. becau≈øe he is the <hi>great Shepherd,</hi> therefore he mu≈øt <hi>dye;</hi> but becau≈øe he is the <hi>great Shepherd,</hi> therefore he cannot continue in the ≈øtate of the Dead; Death mu≈øt not triumph over <hi>the great Shepherd of the ≈øheep,</hi> no, not by any means. As it was <hi>nece≈ø≈øary</hi> that he ≈øhould <hi>dye,</hi> much more that he ≈øhould <hi>ri≈øe</hi> again. We read <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. concerning two Prophets: when they had fini≈øhed their cour≈øe they dye, and their dead bodies are ca≈øt into the ≈øtreets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but we read al≈øo of their re≈øurrection. There is a twofold ≈øtate incident to tho≈øe per≈øons, one ≈øtate of <hi>dying,</hi> another ≈øtate of <hi>ri≈øing;</hi> and ≈øo it is not peculiar to Chri≈øt only, but to others with him. The <hi>great Shepherd of the Sheep dies;</hi> no wonder if the <hi>little Shepherds dye</hi> too. But the <hi>great Shepherd is rai≈øed,</hi> ≈øo ≈øhall the <hi>little ones</hi> in their order, and in their time, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.6. <hi>When the chief Shepherd ≈øhall appear, ye ≈øhall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</hi> Re≈øurrection is that which Chri≈øt exemplifies fir≈øt in his own Per≈øon, in order to a≈ø≈øure all his members, they ≈øhall attain to the ≈øame ≈øtate with him; and God is as ea≈øily able to provide, when he ≈øees expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, to rai≈øe them from the dead, as to ≈øuffer them to dye. Chri≈øt he <hi>brought again</hi> by a high hand, and in a tryumphant manner; he did not with ≈øo much ≈øorrow and trouble to him≈øelf, and his Di≈øciples, go to, but as triumphantly come from the grave: So can God, with a word, in a moment bring them to life again.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By what means the great Shepherd comes to have this honor confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon him, that he ≈øhould be rai≈øed from the dead? There was worth enough in his per≈øon, but 'tis not altogether a≈øcribed to this; but <hi>(through
<pb facs="tcp:62760:114"/>the blood of the everla≈øting Covenant</hi>) <hi>i.e.</hi> by, and in, the virtue and efficacy of it: he had died as a Prie≈øt, and his blood was a blood of ≈øacrifice, and it was ≈øhed for the remi≈ø≈øion of ≈øins, and ≈øalvation of ≈øouls; becau≈øe Chri≈øt did die for ≈øo noble an end as this, and in ≈øuch a manner as that his death became a ≈øacrifice, and did ≈øeal the <hi>everla≈øting Covenant,</hi> wherefore Chri≈øt is the <hi>Mediator;</hi> therefore with con≈øideration of this blood of Chri≈øt and of the ends, u≈øes, and benefits of it: hereupon it is that Chri≈øt is rai≈øed from the dead. In <hi>Zac.</hi> 9. the re≈øurrection of Chri≈øt was prophe≈øied of, but by vertue of his blood-≈øhed, ≈øo that Chri≈øt was more fit to be rai≈øed, who dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ≈øuch noble and honourable ends, as the glory of God, and ≈øalvation of his people, in the vertue of that Covenant God hath made, and in the vertue of the blood of Chri≈øt, ≈øhed for the ≈øealing of that Covenant.</p>
            <p>Now, what this Covenant is, is worthy to be con≈øidered, becau≈øe of its Epithets, called here <hi>Everla≈øting Covenant:</hi> There was a Temporal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant God made with the people of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> and that was ≈øealed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the blood of Bullocks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chri≈øt took not on him this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, he did not bind men to ≈øtand by tho≈øe terms contained in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; for indeed, Chri≈øt came to make void. There is an <hi>Eternal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> and that is nothing el≈øe but tho≈øe terms of grace and favour, which are propo≈øed to us in the Doctrine of the Go≈øpel, which amounts to this, who ever repents ≈øhall be ≈øaved: he that repents and for≈øakes his ≈øin ≈øhall find mercy; and that he will be merciful to all on the≈øe conditions in all parts of the world; for the≈øe terms God will not repent of. If men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent they ≈øhall have the benefit of it, and whoever believes ≈øhall be ≈øaved. 'Tis called [Everla≈øting] becau≈øe God will abide by it, both here &amp; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: the ≈øtates of all ≈øhall be determined according to the terms of this Covenant. Now Chri≈øt ≈øhed his blood to procure tho≈øe terms contained in that Covenant: for the ca≈øe of poor ≈øinners was ≈øo mi≈øerable, that they could never come to have all their ≈øins pardoned, and their Souls certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øaved, unle≈øs Chri≈øt had died and ≈øhed his blood, and ≈øo to ≈øatisfie Gods ju≈øtice, that it might be free for him to be merciful, where he would be merciful. The Covenant is founded in the blood of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, that blood being the <hi>blood of the Everla≈øting Covenant;</hi> therefore the Apo≈øtle ≈øo magnifies it, of all the great and Go≈øpel-ble≈ø≈øings that belong to the New Te≈øtament, to the condition of a child of God, there is not any like unto this, <hi>the blood of the Everla≈øting Covenant;</hi> they that come to this, and have the benefit of this, they ≈øhall be ≈øurely ju≈øtified, and eternally ≈øaved in the vertue of this blood. In the bu≈øine≈øs of being ≈øaved by Faith, it contributes nothing more, but as 'tis an In≈øtrument to bring us to be made partakers of the benefit of this blood: we are ≈øaved not by vertue
<pb facs="tcp:62760:114"/>of our believing, but by the vertue of his blood; ≈øo that, 'tis not ≈øo much the Act, as the object of Faith that ≈øaves, Chri≈øt ro≈øe in the vertue of his blood; &amp; all our comforts and hopes are founded in his blood. The blood of Chri≈øt was of ≈øo much value with God, as that he will rai≈øe him from the dead, and 'tis of ≈øo much vertue to us, that through it we ≈øhall have Ju≈øtification, and Sanctification, and Salvation, God being ≈øo good and gracious a God to Je≈øus Chri≈øt and his Church; hereupon the Apo≈øtle emboldens him≈øelf to de≈øire his further manife≈øtation of his love, that where he hath ≈øo bountifully provided for the ju≈øtification of ≈øinners through the blood of Chri≈øt, that he would provide for their ≈øanctifying by his Spirit. Hence ob≈øerve,</p>

               <item>2. To the end that God might ≈øhew him≈øelf to be <hi>the God of Peace,</hi> he hath provided an all-≈øufficient Saviour for his people, here called <hi>the Great Shepheard</hi> of the <hi>flock;</hi> and God being of a gracious di≈øpo≈øition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, provides to that end Chri≈øt ≈øhall take care of them, and to all tho≈øe things that pertain to their eternal welfare.</item>

               <item>4. It was as nece≈ø≈øary that Chri≈øt ≈øhould be rai≈øed from the dead, as that he ≈øhould dye. Therefore his continuance was but a temporary, nay a momentary time to him.

               <item>5. The Re≈øurrection of Chri≈øt doth ari≈øe partly from the tenour of the Covenant God made with man, and partly from the virtue and benefit that was in the blood of Chri≈øt. God put him≈øelf into a Covenant, Chri≈øt was Mediator of it, and in vertue of that Covenant ≈øinners mu≈øt be ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; but the Saviour mu≈øt fir≈øt ≈øave him≈øelf, rai≈øe him≈øelf from the dead, and then hath all power committed to his hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There are two things that I would have you further ob≈øerve and carry away.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. That Chri≈øt is indeed <hi>the only Great Shepherd of the ≈øheep.</hi> What≈øoever others there are, they make to his own intere≈øt, who≈øoever there be that may po≈ø≈øibly intitle them≈øelves under the name and notion, yet this is undeniable, that Chri≈øt is <hi>the only Great Shepherd of the Sheep:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the concernments of the Church, there is none Chri≈øtians ≈øhould honour as Chri≈øt; and who≈øe voice they ought to hear before his, or by whom they ≈øhould be ruled and governed, but by him. If Chri≈øt be
<pb facs="tcp:62760:115"/>the great Shepheard, then the Church mu≈øt hear his voyce, <hi>for my Sheep hear my voyce,</hi> &amp;c. And if he be the great Shepherd, then the Church mu≈øt be ruled by him, for the Shepherd mu≈øt have the ordering of the Flock, and the Flock mu≈øt be at the di≈øpo≈øal of the Shepherd. And then thirdly: The Flock of Chri≈øt mu≈øt be careful to plea≈øe him, (for fear he ≈øet his Dog upon him) that we provoke him not to exerci≈øe his correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power. He hath his correcting power. He hath his Rod of Di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, (as well as his Staff and Crook) which is to performed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as ≈øeems good to him, for he hath many ways to let loo≈øe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil on his own Children. <hi>Satan</hi> had a de≈øire to afflict <hi>Job,</hi> and God gave way to it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Church of God, is Gods <hi>Spou≈øe,</hi> and there is a great deal of love between the Husband and the Wife, between Chri≈øt and the Church: Yet <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 4.5. this ≈øhe is ≈øolemnly charged withal. God hath made Chri≈øt a head to his Church, therefore his Church mu≈øt be ruled by Chri≈øt; and 'tis not for the Church to ≈øay, the inferiour Shepherds would order me thus and thus, we mu≈øt in the mean while ≈øay, but what doth Chri≈øt ≈øay in ≈øuch ca≈øes? It is not for the Church <hi>to go a≈øide by the Flocks of his companions, Cant.</hi> 1.7. The companions of Chri≈øt pretended to be Shepherds of the ≈øheep as well as he, but have not that power <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> had: They have their ≈øocieties, and would have the ordering of them; but the Church de≈øires to know where ≈øhe may hold Communion with Chri≈øt, that ≈øhe may not turn a≈øide by the Flocks of her companions. There are many Di≈øputations among inferiour Shepherds; but this is out of all di≈øpute, that <hi>Chri≈øt is the great Shepherd of the Sheep.</hi> That <hi>great man</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> never pretended higher, then to be the <hi>Vicar of Chri≈øt,</hi> and <hi>Succe≈ø≈øor</hi> of <hi>Peter:</hi> now we know that the <hi>Principal</hi> is much more to be regarded then the <hi>Vicar;</hi> therefore if Chri≈øt be the <hi>Great Shepherd,</hi> ≈øurely the Sheep of Chri≈øt mu≈øt hear his voice before all other Shepherds, e≈øpecially ≈øince <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> hath ≈øpoken ≈øo ≈øignally in the ca≈øe, <hi>My ≈øheep hear my voyce, and they follow me, a ≈øtranger will they not follow, for they know not the voyce of ≈øtrangers.</hi> And God having ≈øo ≈øolemnly commanded, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.5. <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea≈øed, hear ye him.</hi> The Great Shepherd mu≈øt be heard before all little Shepherds. The little Shepherds have their divi≈øions, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.29. <hi>After my departure ≈øhall grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous wolves enter in among you, not ≈øparing the Flock, al≈øo of your own ≈øelves ≈øhall men ari≈øe ≈øpeaking perver≈øe things, to draw away Di≈øciples after them.</hi> True Shepherds are always careful to make Di≈øciples for Chri≈øt, and to bring all Di≈øciples to <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> All <hi>Johns</hi> work was to make Di≈øciples, to put them over to Chri≈øt, not to make Di≈øciples to him, but to make over all his Di≈øciples unto <hi>Chri≈øt.</hi> If any man will gather, he mu≈øt ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:62760:115"/>for Chri≈øt, not him≈øelf, others would draw men to any matter or manner of Doctrine, Government &amp;c. But our eye mu≈øt be upon <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> and our ear open to his voice, and our hearts awed with his will and mind in Scripture, made known to his Church; and they love not Chri≈øt as they ought, that de≈øire not to hear his voice before any others in the world, for he is <hi>the great Shepherd of the ≈øheep.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Though he be <hi>the great Shepherd of the ≈øheep,</hi> ye he <hi>died;</hi> and though he die, yet becau≈øe he is the great Shepherd of the ≈øheep, he is <hi>rai≈øed</hi> again. The great Shepherd <hi>dies,</hi> the little Shepherds mu≈øt not think much of it, if they be called to <hi>die:</hi> We mu≈øt be contented, if it be exemplified in us, if occa≈øion ≈øerve; for if God ≈øpared not the great Shepherd, what have the little Shepherds to plead for them≈øelves that they ≈øhould be ≈øpared? If the ca≈øe fall out, while Habour to ≈øerve the <hi>Church</hi> as I can, I come to ≈øuffer for the Church in the end, I do reioyce, and I will rejoyce. And truly we had need to pray for ≈øuch a ≈øpirit as this; for, if this was in the great Shepherd of the ≈øheep, it will very well become the little Shepherds. But again≈øt the fear of death here's the comfort. The great Shepherd of the ≈øheep dies, yet is rai≈øed from the dead; ≈øo ≈øhall the little ones; not one Member of the flock, death can always triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him. In this re≈øpect <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> will have all his Members to be rai≈øed, in that he got the victory over death; for Chri≈øt aro≈øe as the <hi>Fir≈øt Fruits,</hi> and a≈øcended into Heaven as a <hi>fore-runner.</hi> Though we may have denial as to the advancing of Chri≈øts ≈øervice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the re≈øurrection of the dead is that we mu≈øt take into our thoughts, and 'tis our ≈øolid comfort, God will one day bring all the ≈øheep together into one Fold, and <hi>David</hi> ≈øhall be their King, and have the ruling and ordering of them to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. There is a Re≈øurrection to little Shepherds: when we come to lay down our natural lives, we-can look for no other recompence for it but our Re≈øurrection, and the thoughts of it mu≈øt be our comfort. And oh! how doth this encourage us to come unto God, though ≈øin be heavy upon us? Remember, there is a <hi>God of Peace,</hi> that takes to him≈øelf his Name, for this very end, that ≈øinners may know for their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, that Reconciliation is wrought out between God and them, through Je≈øus Chri≈øt; and if they will but come and take hold of the blood of the everla≈øting Covenant, Chri≈øt hath ≈øaid, they ≈øhall have all the ble≈ø≈øings and benefits promi≈øed in the Covenant of Grace, and that the blood of Chri≈øt can procure for them; they ≈øhall have forgivene≈øs of ≈øins, and ≈øalvation of Soul.

            <p>But how is it po≈ø≈øible fle≈øh and blood ≈øhould attain to this? that they ≈øhould be <hi>perfect in every good work?</hi> Why, ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, <hi>working in you that which is well plea≈øing in his ≈øight, through Je≈øus Chri≈øt. Working in you:</hi> You ≈øee thereby all our works depend on God, and 'tis in vain for us to build on any Foundation but this; for 'tis God that worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good <hi>plea≈øure,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. through the faith of the operation of God; <hi>working in you,</hi> or doing in you, or cau≈øing in you, or making in you, that which is well-plea≈øing in his ≈øight. Our work is to depend on Gods work; our outward working, depends on Gods inward working.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>that which is acceptable in Gods ≈øight,</hi> but 'tis only <hi>through Je≈øus Chri≈øt;</hi> good works them≈øelves, though never ≈øo good, agreeable to the Law and Go≈øpel; yet if God look not on our per≈øons and works through Chri≈øt, they will not ≈øerve the turn, ye cannot be accepted; <hi>working in you that which is well-plea≈øing in his ≈øight, through Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> Will God be plea≈øed with nothing, but only for Chri≈øt Je≈øus his ≈øake? and if it do not plea≈øe Chri≈øt, it will not plea≈øe God. 'Tis truly, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, verily ≈øo. That which God cannot accept of through Chri≈øt, he doth not accept at all; but now things are ≈øo ordered, that God hath put all things into Chri≈øts hands; Chri≈øt Je≈øus hath the ordering of the <hi>Wor≈øhip</hi> and <hi>Gouernment</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> he hath the making of all the Articles of the Chri≈øtians Creed; a Chri≈øtian is bound to believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what Chri≈øt teaches, as nece≈ø≈øary to Salvation; ≈øo that in
<pb facs="tcp:62760:116"/>Chri≈øt we are compleat, if we believe as he teaches us to believe; and if we wor≈øhip God as he teaches us to wor≈øhip God, and have ≈øuch order and government concerning his hou≈øe, and walk ≈øo as we de≈øire in all things to plea≈øe our Lord and Ma≈øter, and have him before our eyes; then are we returned unto Chri≈øt, the Shepherd and Bi≈øhop of our ≈øouls. But if we pre≈øent God with any kind of Creed, Model of Wor≈øhip, or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that hath not Chri≈øts Image and ≈øtamp upon it, God will ≈øay, as Chri≈øt concerning the money, <hi>Who≈øe Image or Super≈øcription doth it bear?</hi> If we can ≈øay <hi>Chri≈øt</hi>'s; the way of wor≈øhip we have learned from Chri≈øt, that Order and Government in the Church we have learned from Chri≈øt, then the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son</hi> will own it: If it have <hi>Mans ≈øuper≈øcription</hi> upon it, not Gods or Chri≈øt, I cannot tell how we ≈øhould pre≈øume it can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, through Chri≈øt; for God hath ≈øo confin'd him≈øelf, he will not be plea≈øed, but through Chri≈øt; and that all <hi>Matters of Religion</hi> in the <hi>New Te≈øtament</hi> ≈øhould be ordered according to Chri≈øts mind, as the <hi>Old</hi> according to <hi>Mo≈øes.</hi> 'Tis nece≈ø≈øary we enquire after Chri≈øts mind in what we do: If we can do any thing, and in doing it, are ≈øure it will be acceptable to God through Chri≈øt, well and good; otherwi≈øe not. This is the Apo≈øtles prayer, <hi>That God would make them perfect in every good wark to do his will, working in them that which is well-plea≈øing in his ≈øight, through Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doxology. Whether we refer it to God or Chri≈øt, 'tis all all one; we have no body to honour and glorifie in the Church but God through Chri≈øt: We cannot tell how to divide tho≈øe that are ≈øo nearly united. Therefore when we glorifie God, we glorifie Chri≈øt. And this me mu≈øt ob≈øerve: God hath ordered all mens concomments ≈øo, that we have nothing to plead for our Souls ≈øalvation, but Gods grace: the Rule in his Word, his Go≈øpel that he hath made known to us: and therefore <hi>let the Word of God dwell in you richly, in all wi≈ødom.</hi> There is a great deal of <hi>Do</hi> in Gods Church, about This and That: he that mu≈øt determine the bu≈øine≈øs is Chri≈øt; and there are but two ways: the determining things for the pre≈øent, and for the <hi>time to come;</hi> hereafter by que≈øtioning the matter of fact; for the pre≈øent, by making of our Rule. When the que≈øtion comes concerning the matter of fact, there he receives our Rule: What hath Chri≈øt ≈øaid? how hath Chri≈øt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in things of this nature? It's plainly ≈øo and ≈øo: but in dubious matter and cu≈øtoms, and the like, I know not how to an≈øwer them, when we ≈øhall come to au≈øwer Chri≈øt, when he ≈øhall put the que≈øtion; Did you not know whom you was bound to fear? Did I ≈øpeak nothing at all in the ca≈øe, neither generally nor particularly? Could you not by any means come to under≈øtand my mind? I doubt we ≈øhall not be
<pb facs="tcp:62760:117"/>able to an≈øwer this. But we mu≈øt ≈øay we found a certain ≈øtate in the Word; but having laws and cu≈øtoms among our ≈øelves, therein were at a ≈øtand. Why (≈øaith Chri≈øt) was your <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Cu≈øtoms</hi> above, or below my <hi>Word?</hi> Mu≈øt your <hi>Law</hi> be ruled by my <hi>Word,</hi> or my <hi>Word</hi> by your <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:62760:120"/>among them that are ≈øanctified by faith.</hi> It may be called the mo≈øt Holy Faith, in the≈øe two re≈øpects.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Con≈øidering the operation and <hi>effects</hi> it hath upon the <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>lives</hi> of them in whom it is: it makes them a holy People, beyond all the people in the world: And then upon this account too, as to the <hi>uhimate effects</hi> of it, that it <hi>admits</hi> us into the <hi>mo≈øt holy places.</hi> You know the <hi>Holy</hi> of <hi>Holies</hi> in the <hi>Temple,</hi> was a <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt</hi> is ≈øaid to <hi>enter into the Holy of Holies,</hi> that is into <hi>Heaven.</hi> Now this doth admit us into the mo≈øt holy place, where the mo≈øt holy God is, ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, <hi>Having therefore boldne≈øs to enter into the holie≈øt, by the bloud of Je≈øus.</hi> Alas, in the time of <hi>old</hi> they could go but into the <hi>outward court:</hi> but now, ≈øaith he, <hi>We have all this boldne≈øs to enter into the mo≈øt holy place by the bloud of Je≈øus.</hi> Shall we leave ≈øuch a Faith as this? ≈øhall we not hold fa≈øt the mo≈øt holy Faith, that is from the mo≈øt holy God, that makes the mo≈øt holy people, and that admits us into the mo≈øt holy place? Where do we find ≈øuch another Faith as this is? if you leave this Faith that is <hi>≈øo good</hi> in it <hi>≈øelf,</hi> a Faith that doth ≈øo much good to us; and, which is better, that <hi>makes us ≈øo good:</hi> for it is much better to be made good, than to have good done unto us; and beloved, what will it avail us, if God ≈øhould do us good all our days, if we be not made good? if we ≈øhould have the good of <hi>health</hi> and <hi>wealth,</hi> and long life, and yet not be made <hi>good</hi> all this while, it avails us not: now this is the nature of Faith, it is <hi>good</hi> in it ≈øelf, it doth good to us, and it makes us good: therefore beloved, let us not lay it a≈øide, until we can find a better, and that we ≈øhall never do, unle≈øs we can find any thing more holy than God.</p>
            <p>But ≈øecondly, The ≈øecond Branch of the <hi>Object</hi> is, <hi>the Profe≈ø≈øion of our Faith.</hi> It ≈øeems, Beloved, it is not enough to hold fa≈øt our <hi>Faith</hi> only, but the <hi>Profe≈ø≈øion</hi> of it: why ≈øo? truly there is this in it: the <hi>profe≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith,</hi> is as nece≈ø≈øary as the <hi>faith</hi> it ≈øelf; mark that. See this from the mouth of that great <hi>Apo≈øtle,</hi> I may ≈øay from the mouth of God him≈øelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9, 10. <hi>That if thou ≈øhalt with thy mouth confe≈øs thy Lord Je≈øus, and ≈øhalt believe in thy heart that God hath rai≈øed him from the dead, thou ≈øhalt be ≈øaved; for with the heart man believeth unto righteou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and with the mouth confe≈ø≈øion is made unto ≈øalvation:</hi> An <hi>unprofe≈ø≈øed</hi> Faith hath no ≈øalvation annexed to it; you ≈øee the Scripture maketh it as nece≈ø≈øary to our ≈øalvation, to profe≈øs our believing, as to believe. Now beloved, if it be nece≈ø≈øary to believe, and nece≈ø≈øary to profe≈øs, its then nece≈ø≈øary to <hi>hold fa≈øt Faith;</hi> and con≈øequently as nece≈ø≈øary to hold fa≈øt the profe≈ø≈øion thereof; without Faith there is no ≈øalvation,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:120"/>faith the Scripture; and ≈øaith this Scripture, without the profe≈ø≈øion of this Faith, there is no Salvation: now to ≈øay, I will keep <hi>faith,</hi> I will only part with a little profe≈ø≈øion, it is all one in Scripture, as to part with Faith it ≈øelf; for why, the Scripture faith, <hi>If thou believe with thy heart, and confe≈øs with thy mouth, thou ≈øhalt be ≈øaved:</hi> ≈øo that as long as faith continues, <hi>profe≈ø≈øion</hi> is to continue, or there is no ≈øalvation; faith without profe≈ø≈øion, will do no more for you, than profe≈ø≈øion without faith: therefore ob≈øerve what the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. ≈øaith he, <hi>We are made partakers of Chri≈øt, if we hold the beginning of our confidence ≈øtedfa≈øt unto the end:</hi> not el≈øe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A third <hi>Argument</hi> is drawn from the act with the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>let's hold fa≈øt without wavering;</hi> Now there are two things, to name no more, that are hugely <hi>obliging</hi> in this very act, with its qualification; fir≈øt, it is a manly act to hold fa≈øt that which is good: and it is a childi≈øh act to let it go. I ≈øay it is a manly act; it argues ≈øomething of a great ≈øoul, and of a great under≈øtanding, and of a manly re≈øolution, to hold fa≈øt that which is good, but it is childi≈øh to let it go, and therefore ≈øee how the Apo≈øtle puts the≈øe together, <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 4.13, 14. ≈øaith he, ≈øpeaking there, <hi>That God hath given ≈øome Prophets, ≈øome Apo≈øtles, and ≈øome Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geli≈øts, and ≈øome Pa≈øtors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Mini≈øtry, for edifying of the work of the body of Chri≈øt, till we all come in the unity of faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man, unto the mea≈øure of the ≈øtature of the fulne≈øs of Chri≈øt.</hi> Now he comes in the 14 ver≈øe to add, <hi>That we henceforth be no more children to≈ø≈øed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the ≈ølight of men, and cunning craftine≈øs, whereas they lay in wait to deceive:</hi> it is not for a man to be to≈ø≈øed to and fro with every wind of Doctrine; for a child to be bought out of a Pearl with a bauble, is no great matter: but for a man, what a ≈øhame is it? why, we ≈øhould be men, not chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to≈ø≈øed to and fro with every wind of Doctrine: now beloved: you know the Scripture calls upon us in ≈øuch Language as this, <hi>Be cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, and quit your ≈øelves like men; be not children, that will dance after every pipe, to≈ø≈øed to and fro, and always un≈øtable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It is not only a manly act to hold fa≈øt that which is good, and childi≈øh to let it go: but it is a Chri≈øtian act, a proper Chri≈øtian act, a right Chri≈øtian act, it is that which doth <hi>di≈øtingui≈øh</hi> a true <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> from a hypocrite and a counterfeit; you know it is a character of a <hi>Godly</hi> man, he is a <hi>praying man: there went up two men into the Temple to pray, the one was a hypocrite, the other a Publican;</hi> now, what is there then in prayer, that doth di≈øtingui≈øh the≈øe two men? why faith <hi>Job, will the hypocrite pray
<pb facs="tcp:62760:121"/>always?</hi> no not he. I will warrant you, that is well, he held out in the profe≈ø≈øion of God and of his Wor≈øhip and Service; the Sains are always ≈øaid to pray: but as for the hypocrite, <hi>will be pray always?</hi> no not he; for here the true children of God, they will hold fa≈øt; but <hi>Hypocrites</hi> and <hi>Formali≈øts,</hi> they will let go. Now mark here, the Apo≈øtle makes this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtinction, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> la≈øt; <hi>But we are not of them who draw back to perdition, but of them that believe to the ≈øaving of their ≈øouls;</hi> that is, of them that believe to the end: for the end of our Faith is the ≈øalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Souls: now pray you mark by the way, what you draw back to; when you draw back, you draw back to perdition; they that go backward, go to Hell. How, ≈øaith he, We are not of them that draw back to perdition, but of them that believe to the ≈øaving of their ≈øouls: that is, of tho≈øe that believe to the end; and this is the difference he makes between them that are the People of God, and them that are not, that to the end holds fa≈øt, the other lets go. Thus I have given you an account of the Arguments that are couched in the≈øe words, drawn from the Subject, the Object, and the Act, with its qualifications. I think I promi≈øed you a few helps, with which I ≈øhall conclude, take them in the≈øe three or four particulars.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Would you hold fa≈øt? (I cannot but believe it to be all your de≈øires) well then, if you would hold fa≈øt, let me be≈øeech this of you, take heed of all, and every ≈øort of men, that make Religion a Trade to get mony, by which perhaps you will ≈øay, are there any ≈øuch in the world? Oh, I would there were not. See that 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3, 4, 5. where the Apo≈øtle acquaints you with ≈øuch men, ≈øaith he, If any man teach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi≈øe, and con≈øent not to whole≈øom words, even the words of our <hi>Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> and to the Doctrine which is according to godline≈øs, the whole≈øom Doctrine, the healing Word: what then? in the 4. <hi>ver≈øe,</hi> ≈øaith he, he is proud, knowing nothing, but doating about que≈øtions, and ≈øtrifes of words, whereof cometh envy, ≈øtrife, railings, evil ≈øurmi≈øings, perver≈øe di≈øputings of men of corrupt minds, and de≈øtitute of the Truth; ≈øuppo≈øing that gain is Godline≈øs, or as mo≈øt read it, that godline≈øs is a gain, a meer trade to get mony by; from which withdraw thy ≈øelf: If you be not baptized, they will tell you, you are not a Chri≈øtian; and baptized you ≈øhall not be, unle≈øs you pay for it: they will tell you, cat fle≈øh you mu≈øt not at ≈øuch and ≈øuch times; but if you will pay for it, you may: they will tell you, you mu≈øt not ≈øin by no means; but if you will pay for it, you may, and have a pardon for it when your have done, ≈øuch a one as they can give. Oh I be≈øeech you, when ever any make u≈øe of Religion to get money by, take heed of them, faith the Apo≈øtle,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:121"/>from tho≈øe that make godline≈øs a Trade to get money by, withdraw thy ≈øelf, and know, that godline≈øs with contentment, is great gain. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs, godline≈øs is the be≈øt Trade in the world, if clo≈øely followed; but the wor≈øt, if worldlily followed; but to take up a Profe≈ø≈øion of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian Religion, meerly for pomp and ≈øtate, and to get gain; Oh rueful! Is Chri≈øtian Religion made u≈øe of for ≈øuch ends as this? Oh! take heed therefore as ever you would ≈øtand fa≈øt in the Faith, and hold fa≈øt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øion thereof, take heed of all, and every ≈øort of men, that makes u≈øe of Religion to get money by.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Take heed of the error of the wicked, le≈øt you fall from your own ≈øtedfa≈øtne≈øs: this advice you have from the Apo≈øtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.17. <hi>Ye therefore Beloved, ≈øeeing ye know the≈øe things before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, le≈øt you al≈øo being led away by the error of the wicked, fall from your own ≈øtedfa≈øtne≈øs;</hi> the error of the wicked, is like to make one as wicked as they: pray, what was this error of the wicked? It was this; there were a generation of wicked men, that ≈øaid, <hi>It was in vain to ≈øerve God,</hi> for, ≈øay they, <hi>Where is the promi≈øe of his coming?</hi> Only, Beloved, it was as much as to ≈øay, there was no reward for godline≈øs, nor no wages for ungodline≈øs. Oh! take heed of this error of the wicked<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> it is a wicked error, and none but wicked ones hold it, to wit, <hi>That it is in vain to ≈øerve God:</hi> therefore keep this ≈øtill in your hearts, that, <hi>Verily in keeping his Commandments there is great reward;</hi> if there were no more but the very work, it is great honour to us, that we may be ≈øervants to ≈øuch a God; but, Beloved, <hi>Be ≈øtedfa≈øt and unmoveable, knowing that your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ≈øhall not be in vain in the Lord.</hi> Mal. 3.13. there is the like in≈øtance: <hi>Your words have been ≈øtout again≈øt me,</hi> ≈øaith the Lord, <hi>yet ye ≈øay, what have we ≈øpoken ≈øo much again≈øt thee?</hi> this God is always quarrelling with us, and laying things to our charge; what have we ≈øaid? in the 14 ver≈øe, <hi>Ye ≈øaid it is in vain to ≈øerve God, and what pro≈øit is it that we have kept his Ordinances? we have walked mournfully before the Lord of ho≈øts, and now we call the proud happy, yea, they that work wickedne≈øs are ≈øet up, yea, they that tempt God are even delivered:</hi> well now, what follows? <hi>They they that feared the Lord, ≈øpake often one to another:</hi> as if they had ≈øaid, let not the≈øe things take any thing off the edge of our affections, or quench any flame of our love: did God take any notice of this now, that he had any ≈øuch friends in the world? yes, ≈øaith he, <hi>God hearkned, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before him, for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his Name, and they ≈øhall be mine, ≈øaith the Lord of ho≈øts, in that day when I make up my Jewels, and I will ≈øpare them, as a man ≈øpares his own ≈øon that ≈øerves him:</hi> there is a time coming
<pb facs="tcp:62760:122"/>the day will declare, whether it be ≈øerving God or the Devil: well then beloved, as ever you would hold fa≈øt the profe≈ø≈øion of your Faith, take heed of the error of the wicked, never think it vain to ≈øerve <hi>God,</hi> though you may lo≈øe b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> it; for, if ye lo≈øe for him, ye ≈øhall never lo≈øe by him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Would you hold fa≈øt the Profe≈ø≈øion of your Faith? then lay up the word of Faith in a good and <hi>hone≈øt heart, Luke</hi> 8.15. It is ≈øaid there of the good ground; they are they which have heard the Word, kept it, or hold it fa≈øt: where do they lay it up now? in a good and hone≈øt heart: ≈øo that you mu≈øt pull out his heart, before that you can pull out the Word, and will any man ≈øuffer his heart to be torn from him? you never hold it fa≈øt till you lay it up in a good and hone≈øt heart; if it be only in the hands, as a Bible in your hands, or in the head, it will be gone; but if it be in your hearts, you will never let it go: therefore <hi>ob≈øerve,</hi> ≈øaith he, Having heard it, they keep it, and hold it fa≈øt in an <hi>hone≈øt</hi> and <hi>good heart,</hi> and bring forth fruit with <hi>patience:</hi> they had a great deal of ≈øufferings to bring with <hi>patience;</hi> for, if they were not under ≈øuffering, what need were there of <hi>patience??</hi> Well, beloved, con≈øider a little further, as to this, the Connection between the ver≈øe <hi>preceding</hi> the Text, and the Text, ≈øaith he; <hi>Let us draw near with a true heart, in full a≈ø≈øurance of faith, having our hearts ≈øprinkled with a pure con≈øcience, and our bodies wa≈øhed with pure water. Let us hold fa≈øt the profe≈ø≈øion of our faith:</hi> the purity of the heart is the be≈øt pre≈øervative of the Faith. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Holding the my≈øtery of the faith in a pure con≈øcience; a good and hone≈øt heart</hi> will never part with the <hi>my≈øteries of faith,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>La≈øtly, Would you hold fa≈øt the profe≈ø≈øion of your Faith? then look much to, and often con≈øider Je≈øus Chri≈øt, the Author and fini≈øher of your Faith. <hi>David</hi> had got the faculty of walking with God, and how was it? ≈øaith he, <hi>I will keep thy loving kindne≈øs before mine eyes, that I may walk with thee.</hi> Oh! if we do but keep the loving kindne≈øs of God in Je≈øus Chri≈øt before our eyes, we ≈øhall certainly keep the faith. Saith the Apo≈øtle, having a high Prie≈øt over the Hou≈øe of <hi>God,</hi> let us draw near, and let us hold fa≈øt; a high Prie≈øt, that is <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> our great high Prie≈øt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Wherefore, holy Brethren, he partakers of the heavenly calling, con≈øider the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtle, and high Prie≈øt of our Profe≈ø≈øion, Chri≈øt Je≈øus.</hi> Heb. 4.14. Seeing then that ye have a great high Prie≈øt, that is pa≈ø≈øed into the Heavens, <hi>Je≈øus the Son of God,</hi> let us hold fa≈øt our <hi>Profe≈ø≈øion,</hi> Heb. 12.2. <hi>Looking unto Je≈øus, the Author and Fini≈øher of our Faith, who for the joy that was ≈øet before him, endured the Cro≈øs, de≈øpi≈øed the Shame, and is ≈øet down at the right hand of the Throne of God!.</hi> Oh! let us be thinking of, and looking to this Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus. You will ≈øay, what ≈øhall we think of him? Oh! think of this conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcen≈øion
<pb facs="tcp:62760:122"/>in the world, of that vouch≈øafement, which, as was never the like of his; how he humbled him≈øelf, and ≈øuffered being God for man: Think how he became poor that was rich, that we that were poor might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come rich; think how he became a cur≈øe, think how he became ≈øin for us, think what a good Confe≈ø≈øion he made before <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> even to death, and was obedient to the death: Think how he conquered death by dying, and how he ro≈øe again by his Almighty power, and a≈øcended into Heaven, and ever lives to make interce≈ø≈øion for tho≈øe that come to the Father through him: Think how he lived here on earth in a ≈øad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and joyed in it, ≈øo that it might be for our good, and ≈øhall we leave ≈øuch a Chri≈øt as this? Oh! can you look upon Chri≈øt, and leave the Profe≈ø≈øion of your Faith? It cannot be: keep <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> before your eyes, make him your pattern, and you will not, you cannot do ami≈øs. <hi>He that ≈øaith he abides in him, ought to walk as he walked:</hi> he walked in obedience all his days, and was obedient to the death: So mu≈øt we, we mu≈øt walk in all obedience all our days, though we dye for being obedient. You ≈øee now, how many <hi>Arguments</hi> there are for our holding fa≈øt the Profe≈ø≈øion of our Faith. There are many now that might be added, but the time is pa≈øt; therefore I ≈øhall ≈øhut up all in the words of <hi>Jude,</hi> from the 20 <hi>ver.</hi> of this Epi≈øtle to the end, <hi>But you, Beloved, building up your ≈øelves on your mo≈øt holy Faith, praying in the Holy Gho≈øt, keep your ≈øelves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt unto eternal life, and of ≈øome have compa≈ø≈øion, making a difference; and others ≈øave with fear, pulling them out of the fire, hating even the garment ≈øpotted by the fle≈øh. Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and pre≈øent you faultle≈øs before the pre≈øence of his glory with exceeding joy, to the only wi≈øe God and Saviour, be Glory and Maje≈øty, Dominion and Power, now and for ever.</hi> Amen.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>I Began this Scripture the la≈øt Lords day in this Congregation. I told you then, there were three Doctrines obvious in the Text; the fir≈øt was,</p>
            <p>Doct. 1. <hi>That it is the Duty of Chri≈øtians, to remember tho≈øe Truths that: they have heard and received.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>Doct. 2. That it is the Duty of Chri≈øtians, to <hi>hold fa≈øt the Truth that they have heard and received.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. 3. That <hi>continued repentance,</hi> is the Duty of Chri≈øtians, as well as <hi>initial Repentance. Remember therefore how thou ha≈øt received, and heard, and hold fa≈øt, and repent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fir≈øt of the≈øe Doctrines, I applied my ≈øelf to, and applied to the people la≈øt Lords-Day, and ≈øhall not now ≈øay any thing of it; but proceed to the next Doctrine, that it is the Duty of Chri≈øtians, <hi>To hold fa≈øt the Truths that they have heard and received.</hi> That which the Apo≈øtle enjoyns on <hi>Timothy,</hi> in proportion, the duty of all Chri≈øtians, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Hold fa≈øt the form of ≈øound words, which thou ha≈øt heard of me in Faith, and Love, which is in Chri≈øt Je≈øus.</hi> The whole entire body of Divine Truth. Hold it fa≈øt again≈øt all oppo≈øition what≈øoever. Now if they that are them≈øelves Teachers of the Truth to others, mu≈øt hold fa≈øt the Truth, according to the Plat-form that hath been delivered to them; then much more is it the duty of private Chri≈øtians, who are ≈øuppo≈øed, not to have that latitude of Parts and Gifts that Teachers have: And therefore you ≈øhall finde, that Chri≈øt requires this not only of the Pa≈øtors, but of the Members of his Church: <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.24. ≈øpeaking not only to the Angels, but to the Body of the Church: <hi>But to you, I ≈øay, and to the re≈øt in</hi> Thyatira, <hi>as many as have not this Doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan as they ≈øpeak, I will put upon you none other burden, but that which you have already; bold fa≈øt till I come.</hi> As if he ≈øhould ≈øay, This is all I require of you my people, keep your ≈øelves, and hold fa≈øt that which you have till I come. And ≈øo in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Behold I come quickly, hold that fa≈øt which thou ha≈øt, that no man take away thy Crown.</hi> As if he ≈øhould ≈øay, That Divine Truth, that thou ha≈øt heard and received, it is thy Crown, thy excellency, therefore hold it fa≈øt. This duty of holding fa≈øt the Truth, it is thy Crown, thy excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, therefore hold it fa≈øt. This Duty of holding fa≈øt the Truth, is urged in many other places of Scripture, under other expre≈ø≈øions; as that of continuing in the Word of God. Chri≈øt ≈øays, If ye continue in my Word, then are ye my Di≈øciples indeed. And continuing in the Faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.22. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> vi≈øiting the Churches, exhorted them to continue in the Faith: And ≈øo tho≈øe terms of being rooted in the Truth, of ≈øtanding, and ≈øtanding fa≈øt, and many others, they all inforce this Duty. Now for the better handling of this point, I ≈øhall do the≈øe four things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Fir≈øt, I will ≈øhew you, what Chri≈øtians are to hold fa≈øt.</item>
               <item>Secondly, How they are to hold fa≈øt.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb facs="tcp:62760:123"/>Thirdly, Why they are to hold fa≈øt what they heard and received.</item>
               <item>Fourthly, I will apply it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Fir≈øt, What Chri≈øtians are to hold fa≈øt: the Doctrine ≈øays, <hi>they are to hold fa≈øt the Truths they have received.</hi> Now Truths are of two ≈øorts.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Some are Natural and Moral.</item>
               <item>2. Some are Supernatural and Divine Truths: called Truths of God; becau≈øe they come from God, and conform the Mind and Soul that receives them, to the Image of God.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="2">2. Now, though it is true, it is good for a man to be right in Moral things, and to know, and cleave to that which is Truth in Morality; yet the Truths that we are here called upon to hold fa≈øt, they are Divine Truths, Supernatural Truths, Truths in Religion, Truths in the things of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Again, Religious and Divine Truths, Truths of God, they are either ≈øuch as are ≈øo in name, and in the e≈øtimation of ≈øome men; or el≈øe they are ≈øuch Truths as are Truths of God, in the truth and reality of the thing. Now, when I ≈øay that Chri≈øtians are to hold fa≈øt the Truths they have received, the meaning is not, that whatever any man, or company of men offer as Truths, ≈øhould be received, and held fa≈øt; for then we mu≈øt hold fa≈øt many errours: But whatever men call Truth, or offer as Truth, we mu≈øt examine it by the un-erring rule of Truth, that is, the Word of God. In the≈øe things it is a clear Canon which we have, 1 <hi>The≈ø≈ø.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Prove all things, hold fa≈øt that which is good.</hi> Prove them by the Word of God, and if they hold Truth by that, then receive them, and hold them fa≈øt. Divine Scripture-Truths we are to hold fa≈øt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Scripture-Truths, Truths that are grounded, and warranted in the Word of God, they are either ≈øuch as are immediately and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øly laid down in the Scripture, or ≈øuch as are mediately contained in Scripture, and by deduction drawn thence. Now tho≈øe Truths are immediately and expre≈øly laid down in Scripture, we are without di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to receive and hold: But tho≈øe Truths that are drawn thence, we may make u≈øe of our Rea≈øon to examine them by the Word; and ≈øo far as we ≈øee them to be drawn from Scripture, we are to receive them, and hold them fa≈øt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Divine Truths from Scripture are of two ≈øorts: Either the great and weighty things of the Truth of God, and of Religion, which we call Fundamental Truths; or el≈øe they are tho≈øe things
<pb facs="tcp:62760:124"/>that are of le≈øs weight than Religion, and yet Truths of God. Now we are not onely to hold fa≈øt tho≈øe Truths of God, that are the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal-Truths; as that there is a God, and but one God; and that there is a Trinity of Per≈øons in Unity of E≈ø≈øence, Father, Son, and Holy-Gho≈øt; and that there is but one Mediator between God and Man, the Man Chri≈øt Je≈øus, and that he is both God and Man in one Per≈øon, and that he hath given full ≈øatisfaction to Divine Ju≈øtice, for all that by faith clo≈øe with him, and the like.</p>
            <p>The≈øe are the great points in Religion; the≈øe we mu≈øt be fure to hold fa≈øt. And not only the≈øe, but even the le≈ø≈øer; tho≈øe truths of Religion that, comparatively, are far le≈øs than the≈øe, we mu≈øt hold them fa≈øt. You know what our Saviour ≈øays of the Commands: there are ≈øome that are the fir≈øt and great Commandments, and there are others that are the le≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øer: But, who≈øoever ≈øhall break one of the lea≈øt of Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ≈øhall teach men ≈øo, the ≈øame ≈øhall be lea≈øt in the Kingdom of God. So, who≈øoever ≈øhall renounce the lea≈øt Truth, God will be even with him for it. For tho≈øe Truths of God which are little and ≈ømall, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively, they may be of great weight and con≈øequence in their Sphere. <hi>Luther</hi> ≈øaid, <hi>Let Heaven run together as a ≈øcrowl, rather than one filing of Truth ≈øhould be parted with.</hi> Surely tho≈øe ≈øervants of God, the Martyrs, were not ≈øo prodigal of their lives, but they knew what they did when they ≈øuffered for ≈øuch Truths, as men now call Trifles, and not worth ≈øtanding for; the lea≈øt Truths of God mu≈øt be held fa≈øt.</p>
            <p>Thus you ≈øee what we mu≈øt hold fa≈øt, Divine Truths, Scripture Truths, whether greater or le≈ø≈øer: we mu≈øt hold fa≈øt what we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. I ≈øhould, but that I fore-≈øee the time will prevent me, an≈øwer an Objection: Is there nothing to hold fa≈øt but Truth? Doth not the Apo≈øtle bid the <hi>The≈ø≈øalonians,</hi> in the ≈øecond of the <hi>The≈ø≈øalonians,</hi> the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter, and the fifteenth Ver≈øe, <hi>Hold the Traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word or our Epi≈øtle.</hi> The Papi≈øts make much of this place for their unwritten Traditions. In a word: know this, though there were ≈øome Doctrines of Faith, and matters of Practice, which, when <hi>Paul</hi> writ this Epi≈øtle, were not expre≈øly to be found in Writing, that had been Preached by the Apo≈øtles; yet this will not in the lea≈øt infer, that now, when the Canon of the Scripture is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, there ≈øhould be ≈øuch unwritten Traditions, to which we are to give up our Faith.</p>
            <p>I go on to the ≈øecond thing, and that is, to ≈øhew, How we mu≈øt <hi>hold fa≈øt the Truths of God, which we have heard and received.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, In your Judgements, being fully re≈øolved and ≈øetled in your
<pb facs="tcp:62760:124"/>Judgements concerning them, not wavering about them, nor ≈øuffering our ≈øelves by any means and ways, to be removed from our ≈øtedfa≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs in them. Says the Apo≈øtle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Seeing you know the≈øe things, beware, le≈øt you al≈øo being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own ≈øtedfa≈øtne≈øs.</hi> Take heed you be not removed in your Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; hold fa≈øt what you have received, and ≈øuffer not every Wind to blow you off from them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We mu≈øt hold fa≈øt the Truths we have heard and received in our Wills and Affections, in our love to the Truth; we mu≈øt receive the Truth in the love of it, or el≈øe we ≈øhould never keep the Truth. Love is the ≈øtronge≈øt hold-fa≈øt in the Word, no man will part with that which he loves: What makes the covetous man ≈øo unwilling to part with his Money, but becau≈øe he loves it? What makes the lu≈øtful ≈øinner ≈øo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to part with his Lu≈øt, he will part with Heaven, rather than his Lu≈øt? Why, It is becau≈øe he doth ≈øo love it. If men did love the Truth, they would hold it fa≈øt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, you mu≈øt hold the Truth in the profe≈ø≈øion of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.23. <hi>Let us hold fa≈øt the profe≈ø≈øion of the Truth, or of the Faith, without wavering.</hi> We mu≈øt not only believe with the Heart, but confe≈øs with the Mouth, if we would be ≈øaved: When <hi>Peter</hi> denied his Ma≈øter with his Mouth, and ≈øaid, <hi>I know him not,</hi> I am per≈øwaded, he denied him not in his heart. It is a dangerous thing in word, or outward profe≈ø≈øion, to renounce the truth or any part of it. <hi>Hold fa≈øt the profe≈ø≈øion of the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, We mu≈øt hold the Truths of God fa≈øt in our life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øation: this the Apo≈øtle calls, <hi>Walking in Chri≈øt;</hi> and holding forth the Word of Life, in a blamele≈øs and harmle≈øs Conver≈øation. <hi>We mu≈øt hold fa≈øt the Truths of God in our lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, We mu≈øt do all this con≈øtantly, hold fa≈øt the Truth in our Judgement and Affection, Profe≈ø≈øion and Conver≈øation, con≈øtantly and at all times; as <hi>David, I have inclined my heart to perform thy ≈øtatutes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, even unto the end;</hi> We mu≈øt not only in times of calmne≈øs and ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity, when we may have all the peace and applau≈øe of the world, hold fa≈øt the Truth and Profe≈ø≈øion of it; but it ≈øtormy times when Truth may burn a mans fingers if he hold it, yet even then we mu≈øt hold it fa≈øt.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, We mu≈øt hold fa≈øt the Truths we have received re≈øolutely, again≈øt all oppo≈øitions what≈øoever, whether of friends or foes. <hi>Paul</hi> would not bate an inch, no not to <hi>Peter</hi> his Brother, his elder Brother in Chri≈øt, and in the work of the Go≈øpel; he re≈øi≈øted him to the face, and gave no place to him, no, not for an hour.</p>
            <p>Thus ≈øhould we hold fa≈øt the Truth that we have heard and received in
<pb facs="tcp:62760:125"/>our Judgment, in our Wills and Affections, in our Profe≈ø≈øion, and in our Lives and Conver≈øations. And thus hold them fa≈øt con≈øtantly, and re≈øolutely again≈øt all oppo≈øition, on the right hand, and on the left, both of Friends and Foes; and that for the≈øe Rea≈øons, which is the fir≈øt thing I have to do; which is to ≈øhew you, Why we ≈øhould <hi>hold fa≈øt the Truth of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, For the excellency of Divine Truth; it is more precious than Gold, better than Rubies, and all that you can <hi>de≈øire</hi> cannot be compared with Truth. And it mu≈øt needs be ≈øo, becau≈øe it is the immediate i≈ø≈øue of God him≈øelf, who is the <hi>Fountain of Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Fountain of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Glory.</hi> Natural men have ≈øaid, <hi>Truth is the daughter of Time.</hi> Divines ≈øay, <hi>Truth is the daughter of God.</hi> Divine Truth is the child of God, the I≈ø≈øue and Birth of God. And who≈øoever therefore God hath plea≈øed to deliver this Truth unto, they mu≈øt be tenderly careful that it be not deflowred and violated.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is our duty to hold fa≈øt the Truth that we have received, becau≈øe we have received it under the notion of tho≈øe things that have a kind of con≈øtancie in them. I ≈øay, we have received the Truth under the Nature of tho≈øe things that have a kind of con≈øtancy and perpetuity in them. The Scripture ≈øpeaks of the Truths of God, as an heritage, <hi>Thy Te≈øtimonies have I ≈øpoken for mine heritage,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>David</hi> in the 119 <hi>P≈øal.</hi> Though a mans per≈øonal e≈øtate may be alienated, yet that which is his heritage, this is unalienable in Law; it is a wrong done to his Po≈øterity if he parts with that: Truth is the inheritance of the Saints, therefore they are to hold it fa≈øt. Again, in Scripture the Truth of God is called a Thing committed to mans tru≈øt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14. <hi>That good thing which was committed unto thee, keep by the Holy Gho≈øt which dwelleth in us.</hi> That good thing! What was that! Why, <hi>the form of ≈øound words,</hi> which in the ver≈øe before he had bidden him <hi>hold fa≈øt;</hi> this is but a Reduplication of the ≈øame thing on him: the Body of Go≈øpel-Truths that was committed to thee, <hi>hold it fa≈øt;</hi> that good thing, a good thing: the Author of it is good, and it makes us good; all that is contained in it is good matter, and it tends to a good end, the ≈øaving of our ≈øouls. This, ≈øaith he, hath been committed to thee, therefore keep it, that it may be re-delivered, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delivered intire and whole; and re-delivered to the ≈øame per≈øon that did commit it to us, el≈øe we cannot be faithful to our tru≈øt. The Truth of God is committed to our tru≈øt; we mu≈øt ≈øo keep it, that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliver it, and re-deliver it intire and whole; and re-deliver it thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and whole to him that committed it to us, even to God. This is the duty of all Chri≈øtians thus to keep the word. There is a commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:62760:125"/>of the Truth to all the Church and Saints of God; as <hi>Jude</hi> tells us in his Epi≈øtle, ver≈øe the third, <hi>That ye ≈øhould contend earne≈øtly for the Faith, which was once delivered to the Saints;</hi> the Faith, that is the doctrine of Faith, the Truth of the Go≈øpel, which was delivered to the Saints. We have but one Go≈øpel, and it was delivered but once; God means no more to deliver his Go≈øpel, and the Truth of it, therefore you had need ≈øtrive hard to keep them, and hold them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We ≈øhould hold fa≈øt the Truth that we have received; becau≈øe if we do not hold it fa≈øt, we do wrong God, and if we wrong our ≈øelves, and we wrong the Truth, and we wrong our po≈øterity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is our duty, <hi>To hold fa≈øt the Truths we have received;</hi> becau≈øe if we do not, we wrong God; for Truths are more Gods, then ours: They are ours as to the u≈øe of them; but they are his, as he is the Original and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of them. Truths are Gods Jewels; there is never a Truth of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but God owns it as his; and for us to barter away any of the≈øe Truths of God it is Sacrilege, it is a robbing of <hi>God,</hi> it is a wrong to God. This is that God complains of, by the prophet, in the ≈øecond of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> the eleventh and twelfth ver≈øes. <hi>Hath a Nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their Glory, for that which doth not profit. Be a≈øtoni≈øhed, O ye Heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very de≈øolate, ≈øaith the Lord.</hi> The Prophet, indoed ≈øpeaks of a total for≈øaking of God, and all his Truths; but there is, in the for≈øaking of every Truth, a proportion of wrong to God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a wrong done to the Truths of God, when men having received the Truth, and embracing it, hold it not fa≈øt, but ca≈øt it off, this is a wrong to the Truths of God. We ≈øay, it is le≈øs reproach to a man when he comes to my hou≈øe, to ≈øhut the door again≈øt him, and not receive him in at all, than when he hath been in a while with me, I turn him out; all the world now think I find cau≈øe to be weary of him. They who have ≈øhut their hearts again≈øt the Truth, and never gave any entertainment to it, they are le≈øs injurious to it, than they that have received it, and profe≈ø≈øed it and yet turn from it. The≈øe tell the world, that the Truths of God are not ≈øo ≈øweet, and worthy of their entertainment, as they ≈øuppo≈øed them to be.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This is an injury and wrong to our ≈øelves; this is a wrong to our Credit and reputation. Now, though we may make Credit our end in Religion; yet we may make u≈øe of our Credit or Reproach, as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to hold fa≈øt the Truth; and this i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> injurious to our own Souls, <hi>John</hi> 8.31. <hi>Then Je≈øus ≈øaid to tho≈øe Jews which believed on him; If ye continue in my word, then are ye my Di≈øciples.</hi> Indeed, here Chri≈øt doth ≈øeem to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtingui≈øh
<pb facs="tcp:62760:126"/>his di≈øciples; he hath ≈øome that are ≈øo in name, that are not ≈øo in Deed, and he hath ≈øome that are ≈øo in Deed and in Truth; and of the≈øe he gives a character here, <hi>If ye continue in my Word.</hi> You now profe≈øs to believe my Word; but if you hold fa≈øt, and continue in my Word, then you are my Di≈øciples indeed: But if you continue not in my Word, you have the name of Di≈øciples only, and that will not ≈øave you. You can never be ≈øaved, unle≈øs you be indeed the Di≈øciples of Chri≈øt; and you can never approve your ≈øelves to be the Di≈øciples of Chri≈øt indeed, if ye continue not in the Truth, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Let that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore abide in you, which you have received and heard from the beginning.</hi> If that which ye have heard from the beginning, ≈øhall remain in you, ye ≈øhall continue in the Son, and in the Father. Hold fa≈øt the truth of God which you have received, then ≈øhall you continue in the Son: If the Truth of God, which you have received and believed, remain in you, and be held fa≈øt by you, ye ≈øhall continue in the love of the Father and Son, but not el≈øe; according to what he expre≈ø≈øeth again; <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever tran≈øgre≈ø≈øeth, and abideth not in the Doctrine of Chri≈øt, hath not God, therefore he cannot be ≈øaved; he that abideth in the doctrine, hath the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son.</hi> Therefore as you would be ≈øaved, hold fa≈øt the Truths you have received.</p>
            <p>Now here (but I have not time to ≈øpeak to it) is a Ca≈øe of Con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; Whether every error doth cut a man off from God? I <hi>An≈øwer,</hi> No, God forbid: But this we cannot ≈øpeak to now.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, They that hold not fa≈øt the Truth of God, are injurious to their po≈øterity. Our fore-fathers holding fa≈øt the truth of God in the day of their trial; and ≈øealing it with their bloud, was the means of tran≈ømitting the purity of the Go≈øpel to us their Po≈øterity; and if we, in our Generation hold not fa≈øt the truth of God, but carry it loo≈øe in our Con≈øciences and Judgements, and we let it fall out of our hands and hearts, we forfeit the Truths of God, not only from our ≈øelves, but al≈øo from our Po≈øterity. Thus you ≈øee, we ≈øhall wrong the God of Truth, and the Truth of God; we ≈øhall wrong our ≈øelves and our Po≈øterity, if we hold not fa≈øt the Truth we have received. Thus we have the rea≈øons of the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Application: here fir≈øt, I might bewail the general want of the care of the performance of this Duty, which hath appeared many years in this Land.</p>
            <p>We have had little care of holding fa≈øt the Truths we have received. For holding fa≈øt the truth of our Judgement, How many are there,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:126"/>who≈øe Judgements have been perverted with many Errours?</p>
            <p>This is that which the Apo≈øtle calls <hi>A turning a≈øide to another Go≈øpel,</hi> in the fir≈øt of the <hi>Galathians,</hi> and the ≈øixth ver≈øe. And ≈øo for holding fa≈øt the truth in the love of it, How many are there that have failed in that, which Chri≈øt calls, <hi>The for≈øaking of the fir≈øt Love, Revelations</hi> the ≈øecond, and the fourth ver≈øe?</p>
            <p>And we ≈øhould hold fa≈øt the truth in the profe≈ø≈øion of it; and how many are there that have failed in that? this the Apo≈øtle calls, in the tenth of the <hi>Hebrews, A drawing back unto Perdition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for holding fa≈øt the truth in the practice of it, How many have failed in that? that have been Profe≈ø≈øors, and now are grown loo≈øe and debauched. This the Apo≈øtle <hi>Peter</hi> calls, <hi>A turning a≈øide from the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi> All the≈øe things call for our lamentation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Exhortation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the whole work that I will apply my ≈øelf to, is, to exhort every one of you, to the care of this duty, <hi>To hold fa≈øt the Truths that you have heard and received.</hi> Hold them fa≈øt in your Judgement, hold them fa≈øt in your Will and Affections, hold them fa≈øt in your Lives and Conver≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, hold the Truths you have received con≈øtantly; and hold them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt all oppo≈øition on the right hand, and on the left, from friends and foes.</p>
            <p>To pre≈øs this upon you, I think I ≈øhall need to u≈øe no other Motive, than what I have laid down before you in the Doctrinal part; only this one thing more, and that is, take notice how urgent the Spirit of God is in pre≈ø≈øing this in Scripture.</p>
            <p>Now, ≈øaith Mr. <hi>Hilder≈øham, If in tho≈øe days, when the Apo≈øtles were yet living, who taught the people of God with more Power and Demon≈øtration of the Spirit, than any of us do, or can.</hi> Yes, if then they had need of ≈øuch Exhortation to continue in the Doctrine, and to abide in it, to ≈øtand fa≈øt, and hold fa≈øt the Word and Truth of God; how much more needful are the≈øe Exhortations in our days?</p>
            <p>If any ≈øay, no, there is not more cau≈øe; for then the Magi≈øtrate was a mortal enemy to the Go≈øpel, and the Profe≈ø≈øors of it; but we are (thanks be to God) under a Chri≈øtian Magi≈øtrate, who doth not oppo≈øe, but Countenance the Go≈øpel, and the Profe≈ø≈øors of it. If any makes this Objection, I will give you Mr. <hi>Hilder≈øham</hi>'s An≈øwer to it, which I find in a Sermon of his, Printed in the Year, One Thou≈øand Six Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thirty and One; which is now One and Thirty years agone; ≈øaith he, <hi>Though, through the great mercy of</hi> GOD, <hi>we in this Land enjoy the Go≈øpel in great peace, and have it countenanc'd by Authority; and though
<pb facs="tcp:62760:127"/>through the Religious Di≈øpo≈øition of the</hi> KING, <hi>we may have great hopes of the continuance of the true Religion, and ≈øeem to be freed from all fear of the altering of it; Yet</hi> (≈øays he) <hi>there is need of this Exhortation in the≈øe dayes,</hi> and that for the≈øe Rea≈øons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rea≈ø.</hi> 1. Fir≈øt, Becau≈øe of the great danger we are in of being over-run, or over-≈øpread with Popery, and the Firy trail before we are aware: For, ≈øayes he, <hi>The great increa≈øe of Papi≈øts that we dail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>And Brethren, if it were ≈øo in his time, ≈øo many years ago, what is it now?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rea≈ø.</hi> 2. Secondly, ≈øayes he, <hi>If ≈øo be there were no danger of Popery, yet,</hi> ≈øayes he, <hi>there are ≈øo many Errours newly ≈øprung up, that do ≈øhew how needful this Exhortation is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rea≈ø.</hi> 3. Thirdly, ≈øayes he, <hi>There is ≈øuch a general decay of the love of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in all places, and among≈øt all ≈øorts of people, and ≈øo much irreligiou≈øne≈øs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where, that it is the general di≈øea≈øe of the Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore he concludes, that in the≈øe times of ours, though Religion hath the Magi≈øtrate to countenance it, yet there is as much need of pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing this <hi>Exhortation,</hi> as ever there was; namely, <hi>To hold fa≈øt the Truths that we have heard and received.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if you ask what you ≈øhall do, that you may be able to hold fa≈øt the truths that you have received? I will give you ≈øome directions.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, If you would hold fa≈øt the Truth that you have heard and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, get into Chri≈øt, be rooted and e≈øtabli≈øhed in him. Brethren, it is not all the Learning in the world, and Abilities that a man can have, that will enable him to hold out, and hold fa≈øt the Truths that he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, if a time of tryal come, unle≈øs Chri≈øt be his Bottom and Foundation, unle≈øs Chri≈øt be his ≈øtrength. If a man ≈øtands upon his own legs, his own Parts and Abilities, to argue and di≈øpute, and repell objections; alas! the≈øe things will fail in a day of tryal. Pri≈øon, Death, and a Stake, are ≈øuch Arguments, Brethren, that all the Learning and parts of the world cannot an≈øwer, but only Chri≈øt and his Spirit, and grace in the heart. Therefore, if you would hold fa≈øt the Truth which you have received and heard, and not be beaten off from them in the day of tryal, get into Chri≈øt, be rooted and e≈øtabli≈øhed in him, then ≈øhalt thou ≈øtand, nor el≈øe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If you would hold fa≈øt the Truths that you have heard and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, then take nothing upon tru≈øt in matters of Religion: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb facs="tcp:62760:127"/>Preachers you hear, or whatever Books you read, take not things upon tru≈øt, but examine them, and prove them by the Scriptures, and judge what foundation and warrant they have from the Scripture, and accordingly receive them, or receive them not. It is ob≈øervable in 1 <hi>The≈ø.</hi> 5. When the Apo≈øtle ≈øayes, <hi>De≈øpi≈øe not Prophe≈øyings,</hi> in the next word he ≈øayes, <hi>Prove all things, and hold fa≈øt that which is good;</hi> as if he ≈øhould ≈øay, though I would not have you de≈øpi≈øe Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øying and Preachers, yet I would not have you to take things upon tru≈øt, in matters of Religion, <hi>but prove all things, and hold fa≈øt that which is good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. If you would be able to hold fa≈øt the truths that you have heard and received, get a clear, di≈øtinct, and certain knowledge of what is truth; that which you would hold fa≈øt, get a clear, a≈ø≈øured knowledge that it is the truth of God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Continue thou, in the things which thou ha≈øt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ha≈øt been a≈ø≈øured of.</hi> If a man would continue in the things that he hath learned, he mu≈øt be a≈ø≈øured of them, that they are the truths of God. But how ≈øhall a man be a≈ø≈øured that ≈øuch and ≈øuch things are the truths of God? He may know this; fir≈øt, by the con≈øonancy of them to the word of God: Secondly, by the power of them on his heart, to convince, or humble, and quicken it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If you would be enabled to hold fa≈øt the truths you have heard, and received, then get a valuation and e≈øteem of the truths of God. Such as <hi>David</hi> had, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 119.72. <hi>The Law of thy mouth is better unto me than thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øands of Gold and Silver.</hi> Better in it ≈øelf; all the Gold and Silver in the world, all the riches in the world, will never do a man ≈øo much good as that; and better in my e≈øtimation, I value it more, I had rather part with all, than with the Word. A man that is of this mind, he will hold fa≈øt the truth: Oh! that there were ≈øuch a heart in every one of you, as to ≈øay, <hi>The words of Gods mouth, they are better than e≈øtate, and better than liberty, and better than Wife and Children;</hi> if there were ≈øuch a heart in us, this would enable us to hold fa≈øt the truth of God, and part with all rather than them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If you would hold fa≈øt the truth that you have received and heard, then make con≈øcience to practice according to what you know; make con≈øcience to obey the truths of God: obedience is the ≈øinew of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtancy. Chri≈øt ≈øaith, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.48. <hi>Who≈øoever hears the≈øe ≈øayings of mine, and doth them, he is like a man which built his hou≈øe, and digged deep, and laid the foundation upon a Rock; and when the floud aro≈øe, and the ≈øtreams beat vehemently upon that hou≈øe, it could not ≈øhake it.</hi> Mark ye it could not be ≈øhaken: the con≈øcionable practical hearer, and receiver of the truth of
<pb facs="tcp:62760:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>God, he is the man that is like to hold out, and to hold fa≈øt the Word; he that hath been a carele≈øs Hearer, and never made con≈øcience to hear for obedience and practice, he is blown over pre≈øently; it is a ≈øad pa≈ø≈øage I have met with in that Reverend man, M. <hi>Hilder≈øham,</hi> and to me it ≈øeems to have much weight in it; What hopes, ≈øays he, can we have of many of our Hearers in <hi>England,</hi> who are willing to give the Word a hearing, and outwardly profe≈øs it? but what hope can we have, but that if a time of trial come, they will turn Papi≈øts, or profane, or any thing; for they never loved the Word when they heard it; and they never obeyed the Word, but lived in known ≈øins; they take up a form of godline≈øs, and hate the power of it; what hope, but that if a time of trial come, the≈øe will fall from the truth?</p>
            <p n="6">6. If you would be able to hold fa≈øt the truth that you have heard and received, then take heed of rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="6 letters">

Now this was one of the lea≈øt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments that God gave out, for the not eating of ≈øuch &amp; ≈øuch things: yet by tran≈øgre≈ø≈øing this, the people might make them≈øelves abominable: the committing of the lea≈øt ≈øin may make a man abominable to God; ≈øo the embracing of the lea≈øt errour, and the for≈øaking of the lea≈øt truth, may make a man abominable to God: the lea≈øt truth for≈øaken knowing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the lea≈øt errour embraced knowingly, becomes a great ≈øin: and a little errrour makes way for a greater: if once a man gives way to one errour: a thou≈øand will follow after. If we would hold fa≈øt the whole body of truth, we mu≈øt take heed we for≈øake not the lea≈øt truth; if we for≈øake God and his truths, whether in le≈ø≈øer matters or greater, and if we turn back again to Popery, and conform to the Papi≈øts in le≈ø≈øer mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (≈øaith Mr. <hi>Hilder≈øham</hi>) know, of a certainty, that Popery ≈øhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If you would hold fa≈øt the truths you have heard and received, then ≈øhun all ≈øuch per≈øons as would go about to draw you off from the truth of God; ≈øhun all Seducers, confer not with them; have nothing to do with them and their ways, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.27. <hi>Cea≈øe, my Son, to hear the in≈øtruction that cau≈øeth to err from the words of knowledge;</hi> thou ha≈øt been in≈øtructed in the words of knowledge, and, if any would in≈øtruct thee otherwi≈øe, and ≈øeek to draw thee off from the words of truth and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, have nothing to do with them: <hi>Cea≈øe, my Son, to hear the in≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb facs="tcp:62760:128"/>that cau≈øeth to err from the words of knowledge.</hi> Now my Brethren, this advice I judge to be more ≈øea≈øonable, becau≈øe it is in my apprehen≈øion, that this pre≈øent providence of God, in taking off at one ≈øtroke ≈øo many of his Servants (that have endeavoured in uprightne≈øs of heart to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruct you, and the people of God) from this work, it is on my heart to think and fear, this will give a great advantage to Seducers, to ≈øeek to corrupt you, and draw you off from the truth to their party. When the Shepherds are ≈ømitten, there is a great opportunity given to the Foxes &amp;c Wolves to make a prey of the flock: when God makes it dark, and night, then all the Bea≈øts of the Fore≈øt creep out: as the <hi>P≈øalmi≈øt</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 104.20. When there is a night and cloud on the Ordinances of God, then all the Bea≈øts of the Fore≈øt will go forth; many will undertake to be your In≈øtructers, and ≈øay here is Chri≈øt, and there is Chri≈øt; but believe them not: memember the things you have heard and received, and hold them fa≈øt: cea≈øe from the in≈øtructions of tho≈øe that would turn you a≈øide.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And la≈øtly, If you would be able to hold fa≈øt the truths of God, then commend your ≈øelves and the truths you would hold, to God in Prayer, and beg of God to hold you, that you may keep his truth: Put up tho≈øe reque≈øts to God, that <hi>David</hi> doth P≈øal. 15. <hi>Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my foot≈øteps ≈ølip not;</hi> and in the 119.

But ≈øeeing for my ≈øins, and your ≈øins, God will have it ≈øo, we mu≈øt ≈øubmit, and lie at his feet: that which he hath made crooked, who can make ≈øtreight? But before we part, give me leave to ≈øpeak a few words to you; ≈øomething by way of Reque≈øt, and ≈øomething by way of Advice: by way of Reque≈øt, I would ≈øpeak this.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, That if any of you have found any benefit by my poor Mini≈øtry, that if any of you have been enlightned, or awakened, or ≈øtrengthened, and built up in the truth, and encouraged in the ways of holine≈øs, by any thing that God hath put into my mouth to ≈øpeak to you, let God have the prai≈øe, and let me have ≈øome room in your hearts, and prayers, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God ≈øhall deal with me.</p>
            <p>My ≈øecond Reque≈øt is, That wherein ≈øoever you have ≈øeen any fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in me, or any failings in my Mini≈øterial duty, that you would plea≈øe to pa≈øs it by, and to help me in prayer to God, for the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of them. The≈øe are my Reque≈øts of you, and that which I have to ≈øay to you, by way of Advice is much the ≈øame, with what I ≈øaid to this particular Congregation the la≈øt Lords day. Take it in the≈øe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I would advi≈øe you and entreat you, that we may all of us lay to heart this pre≈øent di≈øpen≈øation of God towards us, and the Nation, in this re≈øpect, that we may be ≈øen≈øible of it. I remember, when I was young, and my famous Predece≈ø≈øor, Mr. <hi>Rogers,</hi> was taken off from his Mini≈øtry in this kind, though but for a few weeks, the≈øe parts were won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully ≈øen≈øible of that providence, and laid it to heart, and were much in Humiliation and in Prayer; and I think I may ≈øay, they received an an≈øwer again within ≈øome weeks. Now Brethren, though he was worth ≈øome hundreds of us; yet now it is not the laying by of one man, but of multitudes, fifty in one place, and three≈øcore in another, and four≈øcore in another, and this not by a ≈øingle Bi≈øhop, but by an Act of Parliament, which makes the wound the wider, and the more uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of cure; and ≈øhall not we be ≈øen≈øible of this? ≈øhall ≈øo many precious ve≈ø≈øels be laid by, as ve≈ø≈øels of no plea≈øure, and none take it to heart?
<pb facs="tcp:62760:129"/>Shall ≈øo many burning lights be quenched together, ≈øo may Wells of the Water of Life be ≈øtopt up together, and this not be laid to heart? I be≈øeech you con≈øider and be ≈øen≈øible.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the deepe≈øt and ≈øadde≈øt ≈øence you have of this providence of God, watch over your own ≈øpirits, that you lay the blame of it no where ≈øo much as upon your ≈øelves. Some blame the times, and charge it on their iniquities; others are apt to blame us Mini≈øters, and charge it on our nicene≈øs and ≈øingularity. Might my advice take place with this people, I would de≈øire, that every one of us might lay the blame no where ≈øo much, as on our ≈øelves, for certainly, we have procured the≈øe things to our ≈øelves. I find our Predece≈ø≈øors the Martyrs, when by a Law Religion was chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Nation, and Idolatry ≈øet up, they lay the blame not on the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, but on them≈øelves, and their own hearts. One of them ≈øaith, All this is come upon us, becau≈øe we did not love the Go≈øpel; we were Go≈øpellers in lip, but not in life: Much more doth it become us, who≈øe ≈øufferings are far le≈øs, to blame our ≈øelves more than we blame any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p n="3">3. My third Advice is this, and I be≈øeech you take it in love, for it is out of love that it is given you; if you ≈øhould perceive at this time a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in opinion and practice among us, that are the Mini≈øters of the Go≈øpel in this Nation; ≈øtanding, and ≈øticking at things that others can dige≈øt, and do; and others doing things, that ≈øome of their Brethren can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come up unto: Be not offended, thus it hath always been from the beginning; it is no new thing. Thus it was in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes. If there be any of God's ≈øervants that are Learned and Holy, and Faithful, that do now for the enjoyment of their Mini≈øtry, yield a conformity to all that is enjoyned, I doubt not but many of them are grieved, that they cannot have the exerci≈øe of their Mini≈øtry without this: and we who cannot come up to this, are grieved that we cannot come up to it: the one, and the other have grief enough; add not your cen≈øures to this grief, that is already upon them. It hath been all along a merciful provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, that when ≈øome of his ≈øervants could not ≈øatisfie their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øciences, and come up to the things that have been impo≈øed upon them, without injuring their Con≈øciences; yet others have had a greater free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom given them, that they could yield; and if not ≈øo, What would have become of the people of God? Therefore in tho≈øe things, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge there may be ≈øome providence of God, for good to you in it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. My fourth advice, I ≈øhall deliver to you wholly, in the words of that holy man and Martyr of God, Ma≈øter <hi>Bradford,</hi> in his Letter to
<pb facs="tcp:62760:130"/>the City of <hi>London,</hi> ≈øaith he, <hi>Let us heartily bewail our ≈øins, and repent of our evils, let us amend the evil of our lives, let us every one be diligent in prayer, and attend with reverence on the reading, and hearing of Gods Holy word; let us reprove the works of darkne≈øs, let us fly from Idolatry, and which is the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar I would indeed commend unto you, Obey the Magi≈øtrate, and them that are ≈øet over us in the Lord, in all things that are not again≈øt the Word; and when they command any thing contrary to the Word, let us an≈øwer, It is meet to obey God, rather than man. However</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>re≈øi≈øt not the Magi≈øtrate, nor ≈øeek to avenge your ≈øelves, but commit your ca≈øe to God; be patient, and ≈øubmit to all that are in Authority over you: but re≈øi≈øt not, ri≈øe not again≈øt Authority; but wait on God, till he plea≈øeth to cau≈øe the Light to ri≈øe, and ≈øhine again upon you.</hi> This is my fourth advice.</p>

Now it plea≈øeth God, that Hearing opportunities, at lea≈øt, ≈øome of them are taken from ≈øome of us, from many of us, for a time: My Advice and Coun≈øel is, that the le≈øs now you hear, the more you will read; read the Word of God much the more, and take all helps for the right under≈øtanding of what you read. The Book of Annotations is a great help to enlighten you to under≈øtand the Scripture; and next to the reading of the Scriptures, what ≈øpare hours you have, I would advi≈øe you to be≈øtow your time in reading of the Book of Martyrs; a Book that hath formerly been more prized, than of late in <hi>England.</hi> E≈øpecially, read that part of it which contains the Hi≈øtory of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes; they will inform you of the great controver≈øies that are between us and the Papi≈øts; and they will inform you what you ≈øhall an≈øwer; the reading how cheerfully they went to Pri≈øon, and to the Stake, will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden you again≈øt the fears of ≈øufferings, and death; and the reading of their Letters, will be a great means to edifie, and build you up. This reading of the Scriptures, and other good Books, is my fifth advice to you.</p>
            <p n="6">6. My fixth Advice to you is, That ≈øeeing God hath taken away your Week-dayes opportunities of hearing the Word here, and in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, you would be careful that the world may not devour Gods Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I mean that portion of time, which ≈øome of you have be≈øtowed in hearing the≈øe Lectures. It was a good ≈øpeech of a gracious Woman, now with God, when Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> was ≈øilenced: <hi>Well,</hi> ≈øaid ≈øhe, <hi>by the grace of God, the World ≈øhall never have tho≈øe hours that I was wont to ≈øpend in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heretofore:</hi> her meaning was, ≈øhe would ≈øpend them in her Clo≈øet in holy duties. It was an excellent re≈øolution, and worthy of our imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and if I might after twenty ≈øix years labour here in the Mini≈øtry, now at my parting obtain thus much of you, that you having been
<pb facs="tcp:62760:130"/>plea≈øed to be con≈øtant hearers here, would lay a Law on your ≈øelves, that ≈øo much time as you formerly ≈øpent in coming hither, ≈øitting here, and returning home, that you will ≈øpend that time at home, either in praying, and reading, and meditating in your Clo≈øets; or el≈øe in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, and with your Families, and in≈øtructing of them: If I might but obtain this of you, at my parting, I ≈øhall believe that the Devil and his Kingdom would be lo≈øers by this our parting; if you would ≈øpend this time weekly in holy Exerci≈øes, reading and praying for your ≈øelves, and for the Nation, and for your Families, which you were wont to ≈øpend in coming to the≈øe Lectures, and in attending here, and returning home; and that is my ≈øixth Advice to you, and therefore let me intreat this of you.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And my ≈øeventh Advice and Coun≈øel is this, that ≈øeeing it plea≈øeth God to take away from you ≈øo many of your publick In≈øtructers, that you would every one of you that are head<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of Families, be ≈øo much the more in≈øtructing and teaching your Families: Be ≈øo much the more in this, by how much the le≈øs is done in publick. Read the Word in your Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and catechi≈øe your Families, and ≈øee that they may under≈øtand them: You have many helps for this, as Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> and the A≈ø≈øemblies Catechi≈øe.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And the la≈øt advice I have to give you, is this, that you would ≈øtill continue your reverence of, and love to, and care for the ob≈øerving of the Lords Holy Sabbath. It is that, my Brethren, wherein God hath been honoured in this Town, and in the≈øe Parts, I think as much as in mo≈øt places in the World; and I pray do ≈øo ≈øtill: And when you have not publick Ordinances, and publick helps for the ≈øanctifying of the Lords day at home in your own Congregations, if you have the Word and Ordinances in any comfortable manner abroad, Travel for it, I ≈øay, travel for it; and when you have them not at home nor abroad, be ≈øo much the more earne≈øt, and fervent, and aboundant in your family and ≈øecret Duties, in the ≈øanctification of the Lords day. I have ≈øome fears, le≈øt if time ≈øhould come to pa≈øs, that the Magi≈øtrates ≈øhould connive at the prophaning of the Lords day, giving way to Sports and Recreations on it, and Preachers ≈øhould cry down the ≈øtrict ob≈øervation of the Lords day, and the like; I am afraid we have many youth, that in the≈øe parts, notwith≈øtanding all the in≈øtructions that have been given them, would be ready to dance after the≈øe Pipes, and run into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning of the Lords day: Therefore you that are Governours of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, remember the charge that God hath given you more expre≈øly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this, than in any other thing that I know of: <hi>Thou, nor thy Son,

               <hi>The fir≈øt Query is this; What ≈øhould be the rea≈øon that men make ≈øuch oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition again≈øt the Go≈øpel, again≈øt the plain, powerful, con≈øcientious preaching of it? This is not the principal thing that I intend, and therefore I ≈øhall only touch upon the rea≈øon of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Mens hatred and oppo≈øition ari≈øeth again≈øt the Go≈øpel, becau≈øe it doth di≈øcover their hidden works of darkne≈øs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. <hi>They hate the Light, le≈øt their deeds ≈øhould be removed:</hi> the Go≈øpel brings their deeds of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs to light: and this ≈øtirs up a ≈øpirit of hatred and oppo≈øition again≈øt the Go≈øpel.</item>
               <item>2. Ground is this; <hi>Becau≈øe ≈øinners under the Go≈øpel cannot ≈øin at ≈øo cheap a rate, as otherwi≈øe they might do.</hi> The Drunkard cannot be drunk at ≈øo cheap a rate; nor can the oppo≈øer and per≈øecutor oppo≈øe and per≈øecute at ≈øo cheap a rate as they might do, where the Go≈øpel doth not ≈øhine in power and glory.</item>
               <item>3. <hi>Becau≈øe the Go≈øpel puts per≈øons upon very hard ≈øervice, upon very difficult work;</hi> pulling out a right eye, cutting off a right hand, offering up an <hi>I≈øaac,</hi> throwing over board a <hi>Jonas,</hi> parting with Bo≈øom Lu≈øts, and dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ≈øins. <hi>Herod</hi> heard <hi>John Bapti≈øt</hi> gladly, till he came to touch his <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias,</hi> and then off goes his head.

               <item>La≈øtly, <hi>It is from Satan;</hi> Satan knows that the very tendency of the Go≈øpel is, to ≈øhake his Kingdom about his ears; <hi>Satan</hi> and <hi>Antichri≈øt</hi> know that their Kingdom mu≈øt down by the power and light of the Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and therefore <hi>Satan</hi> and men of an <hi>Antichri≈øtian</hi> ≈øpirit, do all they can to oppo≈øe, and ≈øhew their hatred again≈øt the everla≈øting Go≈øpel; and this makes them to be in ≈øuch a rage again≈øt the Go≈øpel.</item>

            <p>Quer. 2. <hi>When the Go≈øpel goes from a People, what goes?</hi> I ≈øhall give but a touch here.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Safety and ≈øecurity goes, when the Go≈øpel goes; ≈øo in the Text but now cited. The Ark was taken away, their ≈øtrength and ≈øafety was gone.

            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>When the Go≈øpel goes, the honour and glory, ≈øplendour and beauty of a Nation goes.</hi> It is the Go≈øpel that is the honour and beauty of a Nation; and when that goes, all the glory goes: As old <hi>Eli</hi> ≈øaid, <hi>when the Ark was taken away, the glory was departed from I≈ørael,</hi> 1 Sam. 4.22.

But alas! What is this general pre≈øence? <hi>When the Go≈øpel goes, the ≈øpecial pre≈øence of God goes.</hi> This leads me by the hand to the third <hi>Query.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> 3. And that is this; <hi>Whether God will remove the Go≈øpel from</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>or no?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the fear of many, but I humbly ≈øuppo≈øe, No: what≈øoever darkne≈øs may be upon it, yet that God will not remove it; if you plea≈øe, I will offer a few things that ≈øignifie ≈øomething as to my own ≈øatisfaction, and it may be ≈øo to you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The rooting that it hath got in the hearts of ≈øinners and Saints, in the Judgment, Affections, and Con≈øciences both of ≈øinners and Saints. Certainly, it hath got ≈øo deep a root in the hearts of many thou≈øands of Saints and ≈øinners, that it ≈øhall not be in the power of Hell to raze it out.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The glorious anointings that are to be found upon many thou≈øands of Gods ≈øervants in this Nation, to preach the everla≈øting Go≈øpel, and who would be glad to preach upon the harde≈øt terms, keeping God and a good con≈øcience, to preach it freely, as the Apo≈øtles of old did. And certainly, God hath not laid in the Trea≈øure, that it ≈øhould be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a heap of confu≈øion, but that it ≈øhould ≈øerve to the end for which he laid it in.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ineffectualne≈øs of all former attempts and de≈øigns to de≈øtroy the Go≈øpel. You know what endeavours of old there hath been to dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this Sun, to put out the light of Heaven, in the <hi>Marian</hi> dayes, and in other dayes ≈øince them; and yet it hath not been in Pri≈øons, Backs, Flames, Pillories, nor any thing el≈øe to extingui≈øh the glory of it. And then,</p>
            <p n="4">4. All De≈øigns and Attempts to extingui≈øh the everla≈øting Go≈øpel, have
<pb facs="tcp:62760:132"/>turned to the advancement, flouri≈øhing, and ≈øpreading of the Go≈øpel.</p>
            <p n="5">5. God never takes away the Go≈øpel from a people, till the body of that people have thru≈øt the everla≈øting Go≈øpel from them. When, indeed, they have been ≈øo bold, as to thru≈øt away the everla≈øting Go≈øpel, God hath been ≈øevere unto them: But till the body of a people have thru≈øt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the everla≈øting Go≈øpel, God hath not taken it away from them, 2 <hi>Chronicles,</hi> the 36. Chapter, from the 15th ver≈øe to the end, God ≈øent his Me≈ø≈øengers early and late; they abu≈øed, ≈ølighted and ≈øcorned them, till there was no remedy. So in the 35. of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> from the fir≈øt to the twelfth; it is a famous Text for this. So in the thirteenth Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and the 45, 46, and 47. ver≈øes; <hi>Becau≈øe you haue thought your ≈øelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of Salvation, Lo, we turn to the Gentiles;</hi> till the <hi>Jews</hi> came to thru≈øt away the everla≈øting Go≈øpel, the Lord continued it to them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The ≈øpreading of the everla≈øting Go≈øpel, is the ≈øpecial means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God, for the de≈øtruction of <hi>Antichri≈øt:</hi> Fir≈øt he is to be con≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the ≈øpirit of his Mouth, then de≈øtroyed by the brightne≈øs of his coming; the ≈øpirit of Faith and prayer in them that would be willing to lay down any thing rather than part with the Go≈øpel, God will not put his ble≈ø≈øed Church to the blu≈øh, he will not make them a≈øhamed of their confidence.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Are there not multitudes of the Children of Believers that fall under many promi≈øes? And will not God make good his engagements to them? <hi>I will circumci≈øe your hearts, and the hearts of your ≈øeed; and the ≈øeed of the <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>pright ≈øhall be ble≈ø≈øed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The ≈øtrange and wonderful affections and tenderne≈øs, that God hath wrought in his children to the Go≈øpel: What meltings and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and what a ≈øpirit of prayer hath God put upon his people?</p>
            <p n="9">9. There are many young tender plants and buds of Grace; ≈øuch in whom the ≈øpirit of God hath ≈øtirred a hungering and thir≈øting, and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the great concernments of Eternity. I would, upon the≈øe grounds, and others of the like import, hope and believe, that the Lord will not remove his everla≈øting Go≈øpel, however he may correct his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for their trifling with, and ≈ølighting the glorious Go≈øpel. I have ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times thought, what a day of darkne≈øs was upon the World, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect of ≈øin and ≈øuper≈øtition: When <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> brought the <hi>everla≈øting Go≈øpel,</hi> what a day of darkne≈øs and ≈øuper≈øtition was on the whole Earth? But you know what the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. <hi>For after that, in the wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, the world by wi≈ødom knew not God; it plea≈øed God, by the fooli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of Preaching, to ≈øave them that believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When it is neare≈øt day, then it is darke≈øt. There may be an hour of darkne≈øs, that may be upon the Go≈øpel, as to its liberty, purity and
<pb facs="tcp:62760:133"/>glory; and yet there may be a Sun-≈øhining day, ready to tread on the heels of it. And ≈øo much for the re≈øolution of the≈øe <hi>Queries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ≈øhall proceed, as I ≈øaid, and leave ≈øome <hi>Legacies</hi> with you; which may, by the finger of the Spirit, be made advantagious to you, when we are not advantaged to ≈øpeak unto you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leg.</hi> 1.

            <p>Take not up in a name to live, when you are dead God-ward, and Chri≈øt-ward. Take not up in an outward form, and outward privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. They cryed, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord,</hi> that had no intere≈øt in, or love to the Lord of the Temple. Follow God, leave no means un-attempted, whereby your ble≈ø≈øed intere≈øt may be cleared up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leg.</hi> 2. Make Chri≈øt and Scripture the only foundation for your ≈øouls and faith to build on: as the Apo≈øtle ≈øaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Other foundations can no man lay than that which is laid, even Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> I≈øa 28.16. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I lay in Sion for a foundation, a ≈øtone, a tried ≈øtone, a corner ≈øtone, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ≈øtone, a ≈øure foundation,</hi> Eph. 2.10. Since it is a very dangerous thing, as much as your ≈øoul and eternity is worth for you to build on this authority, and that; on this ≈øaying, and that; take heed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leg.</hi> 3. In all places and company, be ≈øure to carry your ≈øoul-pre≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatives with you: go into no place nor company, except you carry your ≈øoul-pre≈øervatives with you; that is, holy care and wi≈ødom. You know in infectious times men will carry outward pre≈øervatives with them; you have need to carry your pre≈øervatives about you; el≈øe you would be in danger of being infected with the ill cu≈øtoms and vanities of the time wherein you live; and that is a third.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leg.</hi> 4. I would leave with you, is this; Look that all within you ri≈øe higher and higher, by oppo≈øitions, threatnings, and ≈øufferings; that is, that your faith, your love, your courage, your zeal, your re≈øolutions, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity ri≈øe higher by oppo≈øition, and the ≈øpirit of Prayer: thus it did, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.18, 19, 20; 21, 29, 30, &amp; 31. compared. All their ≈øufferings did but rai≈øe up a more noble ≈øpirit in them; they did but rai≈øe up their faith and courage: So <hi>Acts</hi> 5.40, 41, &amp; 42. they looked on it as a grace, to be di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced for Chri≈øt; and as an honor, to be di≈øhonored for him. They ≈øay, as <hi>David, If this be to be vile, I will be more vile.</hi> If to be found in the way of my God, to act for my God, be vile, I will be more vile.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:62760:133"/>the day, than from the ≈øufferings of the day: this Legacy I would beg that you would con≈øider, take more pains, and make more con≈øcience of keeping your ≈øelves from the evil of ≈øin, than the evil of puni≈øhment, from the pollutions and corruptions of the times, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.40. <hi>Save your ≈øelves from this outward generation.</hi> Phil. 2.15. <hi>The children of God mu≈øt be harmle≈øs, and blamele≈øs, without rebuke in the mid≈øt of a crooked and perver≈øe generation. Heb.</hi> 11. ≈øpeaks full to the point in hand. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Thou ha≈øt a few names even in</hi> Sardis, <hi>that have not defiled their garments, and they ≈øhall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.</hi> White was the habit of the Nobles, which imports the honour that God will put on tho≈øe, that keep their garments pure in a defiling day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.4. <hi>And I heard another voyce from Heaven, ≈øaying, Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her ≈øins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</hi> If you will be ta≈øting and ≈øip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at <hi>Babylons</hi> cup, you mu≈øt re≈øolve to receive more or le≈øs of <hi>Babylons</hi> plagues.</p>

               <hi>Leg.</hi> 6. I would leave with you, is this, Be <hi>always doing, or receiving good:</hi> Our Lord and Ma≈øter went up and down in this world doing good, be was ≈øtill doing good to body and ≈øoul, he was acted by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired power; he ≈øtill doing or receiving good; this will make your lives comfortable, your deaths happy; and your accompt glorious in the great day of the Lord. Oh how u≈øele≈øs are many men in their generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! Oh that our lips might be as ≈øo many Honey-combs, what we might ≈øcatter knowledge!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leg.</hi> 7. I would leave with you, is this; Set the highe≈øt examples and patterns before your face of grace and godline≈øs for your imitation: in the bu≈øine≈øs of Faith, ≈øet an <hi>Abraham</hi> before your eyes: in the bu≈øine≈øs of Courage, ≈øet a <hi>Jo≈øhua:</hi> in the bu≈øine≈øs of Uprightne≈øs, ≈øet a <hi>Job;</hi> of Meekne≈øs, a <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> &amp;c. There is a di≈øadvantage that redounds to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians, by looking more backwards than forwards. Men look on whom they excel, not on tho≈øe they fall ≈øhort of. Of all examples ≈øet them before you that are mo≈øt eminent for grace and holine≈øs, for commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, and acting for God: next to Chri≈øt, ≈øet the pattern of the choice≈øt Saints before you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leg.</hi> 8. <hi>Hold fa≈øt your integrity, and rather let all go, than let that go:</hi> A man had better let liberty, e≈øtate, relations, and life go, than let his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity go; yea, let all Ordinances them≈øelves go, when they cannot be held with the hand of integrity, <hi>Job</hi> 27.5, 6. <hi>God forbid that I ≈øhould ju≈øtifie you till I die; I will not remove my integrity from me, my righteou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs I will hold fa≈øt, and I will not let it go: my heart ≈øhall not reproach me ≈øo long as I live:</hi> look as the drowning man holds fa≈øt that which is
<pb facs="tcp:62760:134"/>ca≈øt forth for to ≈øave him; as the Soldier holds fa≈øt his Sword and Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, on which his life depends: So (≈øaith <hi>Job</hi>) <hi>I will hold fa≈øt my integrity, my heart ≈øhall not reproach me; I had rather all the world ≈øhould reproach me, and my heart ju≈øtifie me; than that my heart ≈øhould reproach me, and all the world ju≈øtifie me:</hi> That man will make but a ≈øad exchange, that ≈øhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change his integrity for any worldly concernment: Integrity maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ≈øoul, will be a fea≈øt of fat things in the wor≈øt of days; but let a man lo≈øe his integrity, and it is not in the power of all the world to make a fea≈øt of ≈øat things in that ≈øoul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leg.</hi> 9. That I would leave with you, is this, Let not a day pa≈øs over your head, without calling the whole man to an exact accompt. Well, where have you been acting to day, Hands? what have you done for God to day, Tongue? what have you ≈øpoke for God to day? This will be an advantage many ways unto you: but I can onely touch on the≈øe Legacies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leg.</hi> 10. Labour mightily for a healing ≈øpirit. This Legacy I would leave with you as matter of great concernment. Labour mightily for a healing ≈øpirit: away with all di≈øcriminating names what-ever, that may hinder the applying of Balm to heal our wounds: labour for a healing ≈øpirit; di≈øcord and divi≈øion becomes no Chri≈øtian. For Wolves to worry the Lambs, is no wonder: but for one Lamb to worry another, this is unnatural and mon≈øtrous. God hath made his wrath to ≈ømoak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt us for the divi≈øions and heart-burnings that have been among≈øt us. Labour for an onene≈øs in love and affection with every one that is one with Chri≈øt, let their forms be what they will: that which wins mo≈øt upon Chri≈øts heart, ≈øhould win mo≈øt upon ours; and that is his own grace and holine≈øs. The que≈øtion ≈øhould be, What of the Father? What of the Son? What of the Spirit ≈øhines in this or that per≈øon? and accordingly let your love and your affection run out: this is the tenth <hi>Legacy.</hi>

I ≈øay, be mo≈øt in the ≈øpiritual exerci≈øes of Religion: There are external exerci≈øes, as hearing, preaching, praying, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; and there are the more ≈øpiritual exerci≈øes of Religion, exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes of Grace, Meditation, Self-judging, Self-tryal, and Examination. Bodily exerci≈øe will profit nothing, if ab≈øtracted from tho≈øe more ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual. The glory that God hath, and the comfort and advantage that will redound to your ≈øouls, is mo≈øtly from the ≈øpiritual exerci≈øes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. How rare is it to finde men in the work of Meditation, of Tryal

               <hi>Leg.</hi> 15. <hi>Look upon all the things of this World, as you will upon them when you come to die.</hi> At what a poor rate do men look on the things of this world when they come to die? What a low value do men ≈øet upon the pomp and glory of it? Men may now put a mark upon them, but then they will appear in their own colours. Men would not venture the lo≈øs of ≈øuch great things for them, did they but look on them now, as they will do at the la≈øt day.</p>

We did this and that for our families, they would have el≈øe peri≈øhed: I have complied thus, and wronged my con≈øcience thus, for this and that concernment. Will a man ≈øtand by this argument, when he comes before Je≈øus Chri≈øt at the la≈øt day? Becau≈øe of the Souls of men, many plead this or that.

Ob≈øerve, what humbling work, reforming work, ≈øanctifying work, he is about in thy ≈øpirit, what he is doing in that little world within. If God ≈øhould carry on never ≈øo glorious a work in the world, as a Conque≈øt of Nations to Chri≈øt; what would it advantage thee, if Sin, Satan, and the World ≈øhould triumph in thy Soul, and carry the day there?</p>

If you look on this black ≈øide of the Providence of God to <hi>Jo≈øeph,</hi> How terrible and amazing was it? But if you look on the bright ≈øide, his four≈øcore years reign; How glorious was it? If you look on the dark ≈øide of the Providence of God to <hi>David,</hi> in his fir≈øt years bani≈øhment, much will ari≈øe to ≈øtartle you; but if you turn to the bright ≈øide, his forty years reign in glory, How amiable was it?

Con≈øider the patience of <hi>Job,</hi> and the end that the Lord made with him: do not remember the beginning only, for that was the dark ≈øide; but turn to the end of him, and there was his bright ≈øide. Many ≈øins, many temptations, and much affliction would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by Chri≈øtians, looking on the bright ≈øide of Providence, as well as on the dark.</p>

The Apo≈øtle would imply ≈øuch a contention, ≈øuch a ≈øtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to keep the faith of the Go≈øpel, as one word in the Engli≈øh is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to expre≈øs it, and Interpreters very much differ what's the import: The be≈øt do centre in this, that we ≈øhould contend for the Faith, as men that would contend to keep their very lives.</p>
            <p>The Propo≈øition is this, That it is the duty of the Saints of God to maintain an earne≈øt contention, to ≈øtruggle for, and to keep the Faith that was betru≈øted with them: Wherein doth this contention con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt?</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is not a carnal contention; <hi>the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but ≈øpiritual,</hi> the Saints are not called to contend for the Faith with carnal weapons, with carnal power and force: <hi>(not by might and power, but by the Spirit of God)</hi> force and power, and a fle≈øhly Arm, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, Pillors, and Chains, and taking away of mens comforts and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtates upon the account of the Faith of the Go≈øpel, hath been the u≈øual way of Error's detending it ≈øelf: Prayers and Tears are the Churches Weapons.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis not a contention of uncharitablene≈øs. This Contention allows no murthering, either of the bodies or ≈øouls of men: Chri≈øtians are ≈øo to contend again≈øt Error and ≈øinful Practices, as to love their per≈øons, and pitty tho≈øe they contend with. There are ≈øome opinions, that there is no way to ≈øhew a holy way of zeal again≈øt, nor to be able to de≈øtroy them, but by a holy ≈øeparating from the per≈øons: there were ≈øuch to whom it was not lawlul to ≈øay <hi>God ≈øpeed,</hi> or receive them into their hou≈øes: but yet this in order to the ≈øaving their ≈øouls: <hi>Saving ≈øome, plucking them as brands out of the fire.</hi>

            <p>I ≈øhall now ≈øum up all in a word of Exhortation, to pre≈øs every one that bears the name of a Saint, to take up this Exhortation of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle, <hi>Earne≈øtly to contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints.</hi> The ≈øum of all is, to beg that you would be valiant for the Truth of Chri≈øt; that whatever hath been delivered to you con≈øonant to the truth, agreeable to the faith delivered to us, that you would ≈øtruggle might and main, by all Chri≈øtian courage, by argument, practice, prayer, by ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, rather than let go tho≈øe truths that God hath taught you by his faithful Mini≈øters: that Chri≈øt hath been preached to you: tho≈øe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures you have in your hands; tho≈øe Doctrines you have learned by experience, by prayer, by ≈øearching the Word: tho≈øe ways of Wor≈øhip God hath taught you; tho≈øe patterns of his hou≈øe, and out-goings and returnings there, that he hath taught you; be exhorted to hold them fa≈øt, and not let them go: (<hi>Contend earne≈øtly for the faith,</hi> &amp;c.)</p>
            <p>It is to be lamented, that there is ≈øo ≈øad a ≈øpirit of indifferency among Chri≈øtians, as we find at this day. Many do ≈øo carry it, as if there were nothing in the Go≈øpel of Chri≈øt that were worthy the owning by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti≈øing, or worthy owning by ≈øuffering. This luke-warm indifferent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hath done the Church of God a great deal of mi≈øchief formerly; and if admitted now, will do you as much mi≈øchief again. It hath been one of the ≈øins which the Lord at this day is judging and puni≈øhing his poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for, that our zeal hath been ≈øo hot again≈øt one another for meer cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances, and ≈øo cold when we are like to lo≈øe the ≈øub≈øtance: that our contentions ri≈øe ≈øo high in matters hardly of any moment, and our ≈øpirits work ≈øo low when they are to gain the great things for which Chri≈øt ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, &amp; which he delivered to us. It is my work therefore to beg you, that you would put on a holy re≈øolution, that there may be no contention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us (for we are Brethren) but only that contention, who may mo≈øt retain, &amp; evidently witne≈øs the Faith that is delivered to us: It is the tru≈øt God hath committed, and he doth expect and look how we will manage it with courage and confidence, to keep the Faith of the Go≈øpel.

The zeal of Gods ≈øervants is ≈øo ≈ømall now, that though <hi>Balaam</hi> be about the work, we have not a word to ≈øpeak; Though the ≈ømall Prophets of Antichri≈øt be about the bu≈øine≈øs, yet no Chri≈øtian hath courage to ≈øpeak. The holy Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul,</hi> when <hi>Peter</hi> walked with an uneven foot, and began to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dai≈øe,</hi> he tells us, he did re≈øi≈øt him to his face.

'tis but ≈øuitable to what God expects; and the Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here given us, That we ≈øhould maintain with might and main, as that which is our trea≈øure, which we will not let go, <hi>the Faith once delivered to the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To put you upon this, I might encourage you with ≈øeveral things. All the Rea≈øons mentioned are as ≈øo many Motives to this holy ≈øpiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: Shall I tell you of three words further?</p>
            <p n="1">1. The mercy of God delivering the truth to you, ≈øhould engage you to this holy contention: 'tis ≈øuch a mercy as is a Non-≈øuch mercy, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 147. the two la≈øt ver≈øes, <hi>He hath given his Judgments to Jacob, and his Statutes to I≈ørael; He hath not dealt ≈øo with any Nation.</hi> How many of the greate≈øt part of tho≈øe that we call <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> in the world, are put like <hi>Samp≈øon</hi> to grind among the <hi>Phili≈øtinis?</hi> Super≈øtition, Popery, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, Will-wor≈øhip, ≈øuch things as Je≈øus Chri≈øt never delivered to his Saints, having both their eyes out, the Scripture light that ≈øhould have ≈øhewed them the truth, taken from them; and their Con≈øciences that ≈øhould teach them, carried in the pocket of ≈øome ba≈øe Prie≈øt, that dare not think any other than what he will tell them. How many are there, even of the very reformed of the world, who only get upon ≈øome bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken plank of Ship-wrack'd truth, whereby they ≈øwim to the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus? But God does not deal thus with us: you have had the whole Coun≈øel of God revealed to you, a glorious light ≈øet up in the Nation for a hundred of years pa≈øt, which hath been like the light of ≈øeven dayes: For the≈øe twenty years pa≈øt the running to and fro of men, hath increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed knowledge: you have learned the truth from Gods faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters: you have received it with much affliction, with many temptations: it hath co≈øt Je≈øus Chri≈øt dear to ≈øend it, it hath co≈øt you dear to receive it, and will you let it go? Your ≈øin above all others will be mo≈øt provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to the Lord Je≈øus.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:138"/>2. I might tell you that 'tis a time, wherein many let go the faith, and methinks the Lord Je≈øus does by his poor and unworthy me≈ø≈øenger ≈øpeak to this great Congregation, as ≈øometimes he did to his Apo≈øtles, <hi>Will ye al≈øo go away?</hi> There are many that have been forward and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Profe≈ø≈øors of the Faith delivered to the Saints, that have made Ship-wrack of Faith and a good Con≈øcience; will you ≈øplit upon the ≈øame rock? God hath kept the truth for you, and kept you in the truth hitherto, and is coming to ≈øee whether you will cleave to it, and keep it or no. We have been ≈øucking at the brea≈øts of the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and dandled upon the knees of Providences, and gone on in a ≈ømooth way of Profe≈ø≈øion: but what will you do now, when you mu≈øt come po≈ø≈øibly to ≈øuffer per≈øecution for it? to keep the faith, you may lo≈øe your Liberty, Life, E≈øtate. And there's a great deal of hazard upon this account, becau≈øe it hath plea≈øed God ≈øo to di≈øpo≈øe it, as that tho≈øe that ≈øhould be your guides into truth, the Lord is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them into corners. Po≈ø≈øibly while they have been with you, you have kept the faith; but what will you do when they are gone? While <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> was with the people they cleaved to the Lord; when once he was gone into the Mount, they fell into their <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and wor≈øhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped a <hi>Calf.</hi> While <hi>Paul</hi> was at <hi>Ephe≈øus</hi> the flock kept pure, but (≈øaith he) <hi>I know after my departure grievous Wolves ≈øhall break in, not ≈øpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the flock, &amp;c.</hi> So while you have heard of God, who ≈øends voices and warnings to ≈øcare away the Wolves and Foxes from you, po≈ø≈øibly you may keep the Faith; but what will you do when God removes them?</p>
            <p n="3">3. God hath ever had in all ages of his Church, a word of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to be kept, to try his Saints; and therefore it does concern you for to be valiant for the truth. In all the ≈øeries of Gods di≈øpen≈øations with his Church, there hath been ≈øomething or other of the faith of Chri≈øt, that hath co≈øt them re≈øi≈øting to bloud, to ≈øacrifice their lives, to lay down all that they have for it by ≈øuffering. Now even as they, ≈øo we; if not in the ≈øame thing, yet in the ≈øame faith: we have ≈øtill ≈øome word or other of Gods patience to keep, therefore we need to have on the Armour of Light; you mu≈øt wre≈øtle with the fiery Tryal, for there is ≈øome Jewel that Je≈øus Chri≈øt puts upon you to wear, that Per≈øecutors and Per≈øecutions, Here≈øies and Hereticks will ≈øcratch at, which you mu≈øt hold out with lo≈øs of life to keep; and this mu≈øt be till the latter part of the rage and reign of Antichri≈øt is out; and even as you keep that, ≈øo will God keep you, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.10. As you honour the word of Gods patience, ≈øo God will honour you: As you are faithful
<pb facs="tcp:62760:139"/>to him, ≈øo will he give you the Crown, and no otherwi≈øe: Hence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it concerns us all to be armed with a holy confidence and re≈øolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to this ≈øpiritual Warfare, in contending for the faith delivered to us.</p>
            <p>But the great thing I ≈øhall ≈øpeak to, is; Wherein may Chri≈øtians be helped in this holy ≈øtrugling and contention?</p>
            <p>I ≈øhall only mention five or ≈øix things, ≈øome to fit you for it, others to help you in the mannagement of it: I ≈øhall name them mixtly, and not di≈øtinct.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rule</hi> 1. Fir≈øt, Bring all Doctrines that are offered you to believe, and all practi≈øes that are put upon you to practi≈øe, to the Scriptures, the Word of God; try them there, whether they be to be retained, or to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. You will have this double advantage by it;
<list>
                  <item>1. To di≈øcover what is right, and what is wrong.</item>
                  <item>2. To have on the be≈øt part of your armor, whereby to contend again≈øt it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To di≈øcover what is right, and what is wrong; for the Scripture alone is the Touch-≈øtone of Doctrines, and the Trial of Spirits: The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture does di≈øcover it ≈øelf, and doth di≈øcover all things that are contrary to it: when you are bidden to try all things, 'tis not by practi≈øing all things, as ≈øome poor giddy-headed Chri≈øtians of late days have done; who have made the practi≈øing every opinion, to be their trying of it, till they have run them≈øelves into all Opinions: but 'tis the Scripture you are fir≈øt to trie, and then to practi≈øe; who are like the noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> that were more noble than tho≈øe of <hi>The≈ø≈øalonipa,</hi> becau≈øe they ≈øearched the Scripture. To bring the Truths that have or ≈øhall be taught you, or the Doctrines that ≈øhall be impo≈øed upon you, to the Word of God; to ≈øee whether they be according to the Truth, or no: for fal≈øe Doctrines and fal≈øe Wor≈øhip, of all things they hate the Scripture mo≈øt: they are alike fal≈øe coyn, or fal≈øe Jewels, which go be≈øt in the night: fal≈øe coyn will not endure the Touch-≈øtone, nor fal≈øe Jewels the day: no more will fal≈øe Doctrines the Scripture; therefore it will be a great way to di≈øcover them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It will be a great way to vanqui≈øh them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. <hi>Above all, take the ≈øword of the Spirit:</hi> the Word of God is the ≈øword of the Spirit, by which we ≈ølay Heretical Doctrines; and by which we are to ≈ølay ≈øinful practi≈øes. All tho≈øe ≈øtones that the <hi>Davids</hi> of God have flung at the <hi>Goliahs</hi> of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, they have been taken out of the Brook of the Scriptures: therefore reduce all Doctrines offered you to believe, all Wor≈øhips that are taught you to practi≈øe, to the Word of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. All Doctrines that are taught you to believe, reduce them thither;
<pb facs="tcp:62760:139"/>there's no profe≈ø≈øion of Faith to be built, but the ≈øtones mu≈øt be fetched from that Mountain: If you believe Divine Truths, but not becau≈øe the Scripture propounds them, your faith is but humane: If you believe any thing the Scripture doth not ≈øpeak, your faith is Diabolical: the Word of God, and your faith, mu≈øt run parallel: All that is written, you mu≈øt believe, and you mu≈øt believe nothing but what is written: This was the Rule of the Old Te≈øtament, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 8.20. <hi>To the Law and to the Te≈øtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi> to the Law, that is, to <hi>Mo≈øes;</hi> and to the Te≈øtimony, that is, to the Prophets: if they ≈øpeak not according to the≈øe, there's no light in them. When any thing was offered to Chri≈øt by way of enquiry, his common an≈øwer was, <hi>How reade≈øt thou?</hi> Luk. 10.26. <hi>How is it written?</hi> When the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul</hi> would redre≈øs the abu≈øe of the Lords Supper, he does not carry the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to the≈øe and the≈øe Fathers, to this and that u≈øe and cu≈øtom, but brings that, <hi>How it was delivered from the Lord:</hi> he reduces them to the In≈øtitution; <hi>What I have received from the Lord, that I have delivered unto you.</hi> The Word of God is perfect, in re≈øpect of Doctrine, and in re≈øpect of Wor≈øhip. So that what≈øoever is offered you to believe, you mu≈øt try it by perfect rules; for 'tis given by Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpiration, to make the man of God perfect and wi≈øe unto Salvation: it is ≈øuch a <hi>Canon</hi> about Doctrines to be received, as nothing mu≈øt be added nor taken from it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. Therefore it's called a Te≈øtament: Now no man dares adde to another mans la≈øt Will and Te≈øtament: Who ≈øhall dare to adde a faith to the Faith of Gods Elect, to that which Chri≈øt hath delivered? I will give you this as a certain Ob≈øervation, that there never was any thing of fal≈øe Doctrine brought into the Church, or any thing of fal≈øe Wor≈øhip impo≈øed upon the Church, but either it was by neglecting the Scripture, or by introducing ≈øomeehing above the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Bring hither all practices of Wor≈øhip, as well as Doctrine, to be believed: try the wayes and forms of Chri≈øts hou≈øe, by the Word of Chri≈øt: he ≈øhews us the patterns thereof, the our-goings, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings thereof: he was faithful in all his hou≈øe, even as <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> was, who did not leave a pin of the Tabernacle, but did appoint it. There is nothing decent and comely in the Church, which is ≈øo much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, but what comes in by Chri≈øts in≈øtitution. What-ever you wor≈øhip without a warrant from the Word of God, or by what-ever means you wor≈øhip without a warrant from the Word of God, you wor≈øhip you know not what, <hi>John</hi> 4.20. 'Tis Will-wor≈øhip; and by the ≈øame Rule you receive one Will-wor≈øhip, you may receive twenty; 'Tis vain wor≈øhip, it will never reach the end of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb facs="tcp:62760:140"/>with God: (for he is a Spirit, and ≈øeeks ≈øuch Wor≈øhippers:) it will never bring you to the enjoyment of God: therefore in point of Wor≈øhip, bring it to the Word of God; and as to Faith and Wor≈øhip, ≈øay, Hitherto, my Faith, and my Wor≈øhip, ≈øhalt thou go and no further. This rule rightly improved, will di≈ø-intangle you from the hooks, and take you off from the baits of tho≈øe cunning Fowlers (for to ≈øuch the Apo≈øtle doth compare them in the New Te≈øtament) who ≈øeek to betray ≈øouls from the ≈øimplicity of Go≈øpel-faith. Never any did invent fal≈øe Doctrine, but to put up them, they put down the Scripture, and they put out the eyes of Chri≈øtians to make them bend to it. Before they u≈øe other means to compel them, their great work is to darken the light, or the truth; and in the room of the Scripture to be your rule, they ≈øet up other Rules: which, becau≈øe there are three marvellous Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, I de≈øire to mention them in oppo≈øition to this Rule I have given you.</p>
            <p>There's a three-fold rule men would ≈øet up to deceive poor ≈øouls: The Name of a Church: Ancient Cu≈øtoms: The Generality of tho≈øe where they live.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The ≈øpecious Name of a Church, to make that a Rule to Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and to Wor≈øhip. It was the plea of the Popi≈øh Party in the <hi>Marian</hi> dayes; What! will you not believe the Church? hath not the Church power to make In≈øtitutions and Canons about this, and that, and the other? will you not believe the Church? will will you go out from the true Church? Thus do men that go about to deceive; nothing like it, as to the catching and deluding many poor ≈øouls, by making the Church their Rule. It was the way of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øh Party of old, and if Antichri≈øt ever hath power again over the Church of Chri≈øt, in that mea≈øure and degree it has had, you mu≈øt expect it again; therefore let me caution you again≈øt it. Can we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire who this Church was? It was only the decree of the proud Church, Antichri≈øt of old, and the Antichri≈øtian Clergy, who, (as you may read in their Stories) would lord it over the faith of Gods heritage. I mu≈øt tell you, the Name, and Cu≈øtom, and way of the Churches of Chri≈øt, is a reverend holy thing, even of that that is a true Church: 'Tis a weighty Argument, when the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, <hi>We have no ≈øuch Cu≈øtom, nor the Churches of Chri≈øt:</hi> And therefore I do fully clo≈øe with him that ≈øaid, No ≈øober man will go again≈øt rea≈øon: No Chri≈øtian again≈øt the Scripture: and no peaceable minded man again≈øt the Church: But then the Church mu≈øt ≈øhine by a Scripture-Light: If that be a Rule, it mu≈øt be ruled by the Scripture; the
<pb facs="tcp:62760:140"/>Churches power is not Authoritative, as to give Laws again≈øt the Laws of Chri≈øt; it's onely mini≈øterial, we do believe the Scripture for it ≈øelf, and not becau≈øe of the Church: we receive the Scripture by the Church: Hence therefore when we ≈øet up the name of a Church, let us ≈øee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Church walk in the way of Chri≈øt, whether ≈øhe be his Spou≈øe or no, whether ≈øhe doth act according to his In≈øtitutions, whether they bring his light, yea or no; then ≈øubmit: for it is not what a Church practi≈øes, but what they are warranted to practi≈øe: not what they hold for a truth, but what they are warranted to hold as the Word of Truth: The Word was written after the Church, but as it is the Word of God, it's before it. This therefore will break the ≈ønare, if you be ≈øet upon by the ≈øpecious name of the Church; look that the Church hath warrant from Scripture-In≈øtitution, and then ≈øubmit to Church-In≈øtitution.</p>
            <p>A ≈øecond Rule I ob≈øerve men would ≈øet up to betray poor ≈øouls from the faith once delivered to them, is Ancient Cu≈øtom: (our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wor≈øhipped in this Mountain.) When they would hold forth that which the Scripture is ≈øhort in, they will ≈øend us to ≈øuch and ≈øuch cu≈øtoms, of ≈øo many hundred years ≈øtanding. It is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed that the date, the ≈øtanding of fal≈øe Doctrines, and fal≈øe Wor≈øhips, is ≈øo ancient; for though at fir≈øt they were but Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet to ≈øucceeding Generations they become old: And 'tis a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great truth, That what is the mo≈øt ancient, is the mo≈øt true; and therefore there lies a great ≈ønare in this. Therefore when Antiquity is pretended, if you find not their hoary heads in the way of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈øs, there is little rea≈øon for you to reverence them, or comply with them, no more than there was rea≈øon ≈øo ≈øuddenly to be taken with the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> mouldy bread and clouted ≈øhoes: When matters of Antiquity are pretended, ≈øay as <hi>Ignatius, Je≈øus Chri≈øtus e≈øt mea An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitas,</hi> Je≈øus Chri≈øt is my Antiquity; ≈øo ≈øay, Truth is my Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: for though an opinion hath been practi≈øed a thou≈øand years, yet men may have the Word of Truth in their hearts that is ancienter than all.</p>
            <p>A third Rule that men would ≈øet up, is, The general cour≈øe of the World, or Place, the generality of tho≈øe where they live: This was that the Popi≈øh Party did often mention to the witne≈ø≈øes of Je≈øus Chri≈øt; What! will you be wi≈øer than others? Can't you do as others do? mu≈øt you be ≈øingular? And this is a taking Rule for to make you conformable to tho≈øe things po≈ø≈øibly the Word of God will not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, if you bring not this cu≈øtom to the Word of God: 'Tis not what
<pb facs="tcp:62760:141"/>the mo≈øt do, but what we may do: 'tis not what the practice of all in general is, but what ought to be the ≈øingular care, and ≈øtrict holine≈øs of Chri≈øtians in particular, that the Word of God will allow: Chri≈øtians are not to be conformable to the pre≈øent World, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. The Word will tell you, It is no more ≈øafe to follow a multitude to do evil, than it will be ≈øweet to be in Hell with a great company: The Word will let you know, the ≈øecrets of the Lord are with a very few, and tho≈øe, them that fear him: as for the whole world, it lies in wickedne≈øs: The Word will tell you, The wayes of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and the profe≈ø≈øion of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, is commonly called a Sect; it is every where ≈øpoken again≈øt, and men hate it every where: Therefore ≈øet up a Rule in your hearts, in your hou≈øes, in your meditations, in your practi≈øe.</p>

            <p>Be very well rooted and e≈øtabli≈øhed in the faith that hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to you. I ob≈øerve one of the great rea≈øons why Chri≈øtians ≈øo ea≈øily let go the profe≈ø≈øion they have made, is, becau≈øe they were never well built upon it, nor e≈øtabli≈øhed in it. There are many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians, that, through their own itching ears, heaping up Teachers to them≈øelves, have never been rooted or e≈øtabli≈øhed in the truth; the Lord pitty them and keep them this day: Many Chri≈øtians that have attended to e≈øtabli≈øhing means, yet never ≈øeriou≈øly con≈øidered nor laid things to their heart, but are like tho≈øe the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaks of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12. that had need to learn the fir≈øt Oracles of God. How many among us profe≈øs with the highe≈øt, but have little ground for their faith? onely (with the Jews) the Traditions of the Elders, the cu≈øtom of the place, Education, and becau≈øe ≈øuch a party of men ≈øay ≈øo, becau≈øe no body denies it, becau≈øe Mini≈øters commonly preached it; but to have any ≈øolid and ≈øerious ground, they are yet to ≈øeek. 'Tis not with the things of God, as with other Arts, as Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, Rhetorick, A≈øtronomy; in the≈øe Arts the principal is pre≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to be proved; no man goes about to prove there is Rea≈øon, that there is Number, that there are Heavenly Bodies, becau≈øe ≈øen≈øe and experience ≈øhews it. But 'tis quite otherwi≈øe in the things of God: for you are not onely to run away with the notion, that there is a God, that this God is one, and that the≈øe are his Words and his Works; but you are to know this by experience, becau≈øe the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the≈øe things comes by infu≈øion, by faith, by a belief that God is: <hi>For by faith we believe the Worlds were made by the Word of God, Hebr.</hi> 11.3. It is that therefore I would pre≈øs you to, that
<pb facs="tcp:62760:141"/>you would labour for an e≈øtabli≈øhed Spirit: Do not onely hear the things of God, but ≈øee them; the fir≈øt will but blinde you, or at be≈øt leave you at great uncertainties; the la≈øt will ≈øettle you. What was the rea≈øon of the holy Apo≈øtles zeal, when they were under the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt threatnings of the High Prie≈øts, and were forbid to ≈øpeak in the name of Chri≈øt, and to ≈øpeak of Ju≈øtification by faith, and the Re≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chri≈øt from the dead, and forgivene≈øs of ≈øins by him? (things that are further remote from ≈øen≈øe and rea≈øon) the Apo≈øtle will tell you, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.20. <hi>We cannot but ≈øpeak the things we have ≈øeen and heard.</hi> Hence it is that poor ≈øilly women, that in re≈øpect of their Imbecillity and Infirmity of Sex, the terrours of the fire and faggot, might have been ≈øuch to have brought them to Apo≈øtacy, yet they confounded the great Doctors and Rabbies when they were brought before them; they were able to burn, though they could not di≈øpute; they beheld things that were invi≈øible. It's an excellent thing not to take up the Word upon notion, upon opinion, but to have an e≈øtabli≈øhed heart through Grace. I ≈øhall direct you in two words.</p>

Arm your ≈øelves with Re≈øolutions to ≈øuffer for the faith of the Go≈øpel, and for the wayes of Je≈øus Chri≈øt; As you ≈øhould love the truth above your lives, ≈øo labour to be made willing to part with Life, E≈øtate, Liberty, any thing for to keep the wayes of Je≈øus Chri≈øt. It is not the honour of the Go≈øpel of Chri≈øt to hear Chri≈øtians to break out into murmurings, pa≈ø≈øions, di≈øcontents, contentions that are
<pb facs="tcp:62760:143"/>carnal and ≈øinful; your work is, humbly, meekly, and patiently to lie under the hand of God, and under the hand of man too; that becomes Chri≈øtians. Suffering is that that will re≈øtore the glory of Religion, that will keep the truth delivered to you, that will honour the Cau≈øe of Chri≈øt be≈øt of all: follow the <hi>example of ble≈ø≈øed Paul:</hi> his his expre≈ø≈øion is worthy of con≈øideration, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.9. he gives a charge of keeping and propagating one of the mo≈øt glorious truths, <hi>(that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt was ri≈øen from the dead)</hi> yet a thing that is farthe≈øt off from ≈øen≈øe and rea≈øon, <hi>(wherein I ≈øuffer trouble:)</hi> Mark, <hi>Paul</hi> does not ≈øay, wherein I make trouble; no, but <hi>wherein I ≈øuffer trouble, as an evil doer, unto bonds, but the Word of God is not bound.</hi> If this ble≈ø≈øed and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Apo≈øtle would have had the faith of God bound, and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented him≈øelf with ≈øinful ≈øilence, and not propagated the Go≈øpel, <hi>Paul</hi> might have been free; but <hi>Paul</hi> would not have the Word of God bound, therefore <hi>Paul</hi> would ≈øuffer for it. Shall we go higher a great deal than this? You have the glorious commendation of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt upon this account, that he gave a free and full account of the Doctrine of his Father, and of his glorious per≈øon, before <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate,</hi> a bloudy Per≈øecutor. It was not by ≈øaying to his Di≈øciples <hi>Fight;</hi> nor by ≈øaying, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World:</hi> but he gave a glorious confe≈ø≈øion before the face of <hi>Pilate,</hi> of the righteou≈øne≈øs of his Truth, Doctrine, Go≈øpel, and of his Per≈øon. Fear to en≈ønare the freedom of the Truth, with your own Liberty; do not en≈ønare it to your own lu≈øts, nor to the will of any man. Oh! that we could ≈øtudy, and improve the≈øe Scriptures more! it would make us fear God more, and man le≈øs. This is that that would make us to ≈øay, as holy <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 119.161. <hi>Princes have per≈øecuted me without a cau≈øe, but my heart ≈øtandeth in awe of thy word:</hi> for he that hath the mo≈øt fear on you, and upon you, you will be more afraid to fall into his hands. It is a childi≈øh thing for a Chri≈øtian to tread down the belief of any Doctrine, or practi≈øe any Wor≈øhip for fear of man, who hath no more power to hurt us, than we give him our ≈øelves by our fear; <hi>Fear not him that can kill the body, &amp;c.</hi> It was the way of Gods people for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, that they came to divide between duty commanded by God, and commanded by Man. You may read in all the dayes of Antichri≈øts per≈øecution, from the beginning they came to divide in matter of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God and his truth; and wor≈øhip and obedience to Man. Chri≈øtians! nothing but a ≈øuffering ≈øpirit will help you to this, for there is no other way of Obedience in this ca≈øe to Authority, but to ≈øuffer under it meekly, patiently, as Lambs: This made the three
<pb facs="tcp:62760:143"/>children to divide between the command of the King, and the command of God: What ≈øayes <hi>Nebuchadnezzar?

Yes, they will obey him; by ≈øuffering, as becomes Chri≈øtians, and is the example of Chri≈øt: as if they ≈øhould ≈øay, Truely we are terrified with the burning Furnace, but we are terrified with Hell too: We are terrified by the threats of the great King, but we are likewi≈øe terrified with the threats of the great God: He is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us our of your torments, you are not able to deliver us from his torments: ≈øo in the ca≈øe of <hi>Daniel.</hi> Arm your ≈øelves with this Re≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of ≈øuffering, and lying down patiently and meekly under tho≈øe things that you cannot do, ≈øo that God may be honoured by your holy re≈øolution upon this account: for truly, you never do contend ≈øucce≈øs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully for the faith of the Go≈øpel, till you contend by ≈øuffering; for it is ≈øaid, They overcome by the blood of the Lamb: You never make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion your bu≈øine≈øs, till the world ≈øee you can let ≈øuch great things go, as Life, E≈øtate, Liberty, to keep it: then wi≈ødom is ju≈øtified of her Children.

            <p>I intended to have taken up four Appearances and Coverings that Saints u≈øually take up for to hide them≈øelves, as under a covert, to beat down the Go≈øpel-warrants and commands, to ≈øuffer for the Faith deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:62760:144"/>1. The motion that a Chri≈øtian hath of indifferencie of things, that they are but toyes and trifles, that they may be done, or not done. It is not my work to tell you what is indifferent, or name any thing in particular. As I remember in the Book of Martyrs, the u≈øual Argument was, Why cannot you wor≈øhip the Idol? why cannot you bow down as well as others? it is a ≈ømall matter: cannot you ≈øhew your outward reverence, and keep your heart to your ≈øelf? Indeed if there were any thing that is indifferent, a Chri≈øtian hath a marvellous latitude in point of Doctrine, in point of Wor≈øhip: I would caution you therefore. The term of <hi>indifferent,</hi> I ≈øuppo≈øe it is devi≈øed as a Pillar to re≈øt the Con≈øcience on, which otherwi≈øe would ≈øtartle, and look with a broad face upon them. Things that come under this notion, had need well to be weighed and con≈øidered: If they tell you plainly they came out of <hi>Rome,</hi> and had the Plague of Popery upon them: they came from Hell, were hatched there, and the cur≈øe of God is upon them; no body will entertain them. They mu≈øt pretend they came from the Church, from the Apo≈øtles, de≈øcending from the Scriptures; and hence they are entertained with the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and willingne≈øs, as that mo≈øt Chri≈øtians take no notice, but fall down under them; and ≈øo the very power and life of Religion and holy practice is eaten out. The Devil hath three wayes whereby he makes men ≈øeek after him. Fir≈øt, Commonly he doth cover holine≈øs with other names. Secondly, He per≈øwades that ≈øins are but little. Thirdly, That they may repent hereafter. The fir≈øt is ≈øuitable to my purpo≈øe, That vertue or grace is covered with other names: therefore if a man be holy, he is called preci≈øe; if zealous, he is ≈øaid to be ra≈øh; and if it be really a ≈øin, it ≈øhall come under the name of indifferency, a toy, a trifle, and things of that nature: therefore you had need be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious; for it is not ≈øo much what name the ≈øin has, what title it goes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as what it is really. As to things of Doctrine and Wor≈øhip I know there is no <hi>medium;</hi> every man mu≈øt give an account to the Lord what he does; therefore I do not tell you what is indifferent, and what not; but ≈øearch the Scripture, take heed what you receive for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond thing Chri≈øtians will ≈øay is, I hope without danger I may comply with them, con≈øidering I bear them as my burthens. This is very like the young man in the Go≈øpel; he came to Chri≈øt, and would have him come up to his terms; and when Chri≈øt told him, Yet he lacked one thning, <hi>Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>ell all, &amp;c.</hi> he went away ≈øorrowful: So, many Chri≈øtians they would follow Chri≈øt, but they cannot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe
<pb facs="tcp:62760:145"/>there is not ≈øuch ≈øecurity in it, but they will go away ≈øorrowful: Thou Hyvocrite! Art thou willing to for≈øake all for Chri≈øt, yet can≈øt not leave life, liberty, and ≈øome of the≈øe ≈ømall things? Will you wound the name of Chri≈øt, and pretend to be ≈øorrowful for it? I conclude, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>hy pretence ≈øhall not excu≈øe thee; for ≈øo was <hi>Pilate</hi> loth to crucifie Chri≈øt; and, as a means and expedient, he calls for water and wa≈øhes his hands, ≈øaying, <hi>I am innocent from the blood of this ju≈øt man:</hi> But do you think God excu≈øed <hi>Pilate?</hi> no more, will he you: Whatever is brought to you, is either forbidden or commanded by God: If forbidden by God, why do you meddle with it? If commanded of the Lord, why are you burdened with it? why do you it heartily? for the Lord loves one that is chearful in his ≈øervice: Neither man nor God is plea≈øed with ≈øuch.</p>
            <p>A third thing, which ≈øatisfies many, is, That they may follow in ≈øome things the opinions of wi≈øe men, holy men, and good men; That they may do as they do. I ≈øhall ≈øay but the≈øe two words: Fir≈øt, Many men are reputed good, wi≈øe, and hone≈øt, that are not ≈øo: A man may be accounted an hone≈øt man, that yet may be covetous: he may be accounted a very good man, yet be really corrupt in heart, and in his lu≈øts; therefore 'tis good to try men: I dare not tru≈øt mine own heart, (unle≈ø≈øe God give ≈øtrength of grace, and a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtance every moment) le≈øt I ≈øhould betray the truth of Chri≈øt upon ≈øome advantage: when the Devil would ≈øet abroach an evil opinion or practice, it's his comon way to tunn it up in ≈øome clean Ve≈ø≈øel. Men of civil hone≈øty and goodne≈øs: You read the old Prophet drew the young one in, though expre≈øly forbidden by God him≈øelf: When you do not fear a young Chri≈øtian, it may be the example of an old Mini≈øter ≈øhall draw you; therefore it's good to mind who you fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Secondly, Grant they are all good and reall, they are men fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, (as there are ≈øome;) yet God will not let his people know all his mind. There are ≈øome that would, but cannot know all his mind and will; the Lord is free and voluntary, he reveales things nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øalvation; but for other things he withholds. But what is your rule? <hi>Call no man Ma≈øter:</hi> you are to follow no man further than he follows Chri≈øt: And indeed for a man to follow the examples of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, wherein they ≈øin and do not know it; it is ju≈øt like the ca≈øe of holy <hi>Noah,</hi> (who was a gracious man) and knew not the ≈øtrength of the Grape, he was drunk with his own Vineyard: But what's the fruit of it? his Son <hi>Cham</hi> ≈øaw his nakedne≈øs, and di≈øcovered it: If good and holy men ta≈øte of the intoxicated Wine that is too ≈øtrong
<pb facs="tcp:62760:145"/>for them, and know it not, will you ≈øip after them? unle≈øs you will di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your nakedne≈øs, and proclain it from Generation to Generation, and make your ≈øelves <hi>Chams,</hi> not ≈øons of the Prophet: Therefore I know not what warrant you have to follow ≈øuch examples.</p>
            <p>The fourth things is this; Chri≈øtians u≈øually do no good by ≈øtanding out. <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Whether we get good, or do good or no, we are to do our duty. The Lord will honour you for ≈øuffering for the Truth, 2 <hi>The≈ø.</hi> 1.2, 3, 4, 5. And by ≈øuffering you ≈øhall confirm the Saints, and bear te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; you ≈øhall witne≈øs again≈øt all fal≈øe Doctrines, and fal≈øe Wor≈øhip, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole world. By your humility and Patience, when you ≈øuffer not as evil-doers, but as tho≈øe that ≈øuffer for the Word of Righteou≈øne≈øs, the Word of Truth, for holding fa≈øt the Lord Je≈øus and his Faith, that is more precious than Heaven and Earth, than any created thing: this will make your name as a ≈øweet ≈øavour to all Generations; when tho≈øe that Apo≈øtatize, Per≈øecute, and oppo≈øe Je≈øus Chri≈øt, their memories ≈øhall be left as a cur≈øe to the people of God.</p>

            <p>THere is nothing ≈øo excellent or compleat in this World, but hath its dimini≈øhment and qualifications; and ≈øomething that doth rage it, and abates it of the excellency thereof; not the things of this World only, but ≈øpiritual things in ≈øome ≈øort, as to enjoy them, and partake of them in this life, have their inconveniencies and di≈øparagements annext, and are mingled with ≈øomething that abates of their worth; an in≈øtance of which we have here in this pre≈øent Scripture which the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øignifies to us concerning the enjoyment of the Mini≈øtry of the Go≈øpel of Chri≈øt. He had in the Ver≈øe before the Text, told us the great priviledge that both Mini≈øters and others had in having the glorious Go≈øpel, viz. <hi>The light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, ≈øhining into our hearts;</hi> the con≈øideration of which, is of great encouragement to us: yet adds this as a qualification of it; viz. <hi>But we have this Trea≈øure in Earthen Ve≈ø≈øels, &amp;c.</hi> That which doth qualifie it, is, That this excellent Trea≈øure hath its conveyances through weak and mean per≈øons, men of frailty and mortality.

            <p>Fir≈øt, The <hi>Depo≈øitum,</hi> or thing laid up, which is a Trea≈øure; and what is this Trea≈øure, but the Go≈øpel of Je≈øus Chri≈øt? The Go≈øpel is a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure according to a two-fold con≈øideration.</p>

            </list>
            <p>Both make up a Trea≈øure. The Matter of it, the things of the Go≈øpel are rich things; and the conveyances of it, the Mini≈øterial gifts and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, by which the Go≈øpel is admini≈øtred, do make up the Trea≈øure: 'Tis a trea≈øure in both re≈øpects.</p>

            <p n="2">2. A Trea≈øure is a thing of dignity and worth; 'tis not a company of Pebbles (though many) that will make up a Trea≈øure; Trea≈øure con≈øi≈øts of things of worth and dignity: and thus is the Go≈øpel: in it are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained excellent and admirable truths, the My≈øteries of ≈øalvation by Chri≈øt; the Doctrine of the Go≈øpel b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. The Go≈øpel is a trea≈øure for variety, and abundance, and plurality. 'Tis not one thing of worth, but many that make up a trea≈øure: if few, yet much worth mu≈øt be comprehended in them; ≈øo in the Go≈øpel we have the manifold wi≈ødom of God, the rich Trea≈øures of wi≈ødom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. The Go≈øpel, though it be but one for ≈øub≈øtance, yet 'tis many for improvements; 'tis a chain of many links, one faith, but divers articles of it; ≈øo it is a trea≈øure in that re≈øpect.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis a Trea≈øure for its clo≈øene≈øs; We do not open a Trea≈øure to
<pb facs="tcp:62760:148"/>every one, but it is kept clo≈øe. The Go≈øpel is a ≈øecret my≈øtery, hidden, not revealed to every one: it is not di≈øcovered to carnal worldly men; though it may be reveal'd to them in the outward propo≈øition, yet not in the ≈øpirituality of it. <hi>But where ≈øhall wi≈ødom be found? and where is the place of under≈øtanding?</hi> ≈øaith <hi>Job,</hi> ch. 28: v. 12. The peace of the Go≈øpel is a trea≈øure hid in the field, not found by every one.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Go≈øpel is a trea≈øure in re≈øpect of the Mini≈øtry of it, ≈øo the Apo≈øtle hints, it is not only, but a ≈øhining light, which <hi>≈øhined into our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the Glory of God,</hi> &amp;c.

Thus the Go≈øpel and the Mini≈øtry thereof is precious, and ought to be e≈øteemed and made u≈øe of by us. We ≈øhould highly account of the Go≈øpel, and put a high value on it, for it is a trea≈øure; yea, it is a trea≈øure in the want of other trea≈øures, they are rich that are made partakers of it: <hi>Silver and Gold have I none,</hi> (≈øaith St. <hi>Peter</hi> to the Cripple) <hi>but ≈øuch as I have, I give it thee:</hi> this is the priviledge of Mini≈øters; though it may be, poor in re≈øpect of them≈øelves, yet are rich to others. The≈øe excellent riches are committed to us, and accordingly we mu≈øt not only make u≈øe of them our ≈øelves, but make them known to others; the Go≈øpel is a trea≈øure not for us to keep, but to di≈øcover, reveal and manife≈øt to others: to give the <hi>light of the glory of God,</hi> &amp;c. This is the work of the Mini≈øtry, we have indeed this trea≈øure, but not for our ≈øelves only, but for others: We are to keep it, to pre≈øerve and maintain; it but ≈øo, as to be diligent to impart what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us for the edification of others: <hi>Every Scribe in≈øtructed to the Kingdom of Heaven is as a good hou≈øholder, bringeth forth things new and old.</hi>

Mini≈øters have weak and frail bodies; <hi>Timothy</hi> had his bodily infirmities, and <hi>Trophimus</hi> was left ≈øick at <hi>Miletum,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.20. and <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> was ≈øick nigh unto death, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.27. and <hi>Paul</hi> had need of <hi>Luke</hi> the Phy≈øician, probably in regard of his ≈øick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs. Thus the ≈øervants of God are ≈øubject to many infirmities. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides the rea≈øons in the Text, there are other rea≈øons, why God will have it ≈øo.
<list>
                     <item>1. That they may be more compa≈ø≈øionate, and more ≈øen≈øible of the weakne≈ø≈øes of others: for <hi>likene≈øs of condition breeds ≈øympathy in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi> Men are apt to pity tho≈øe in the like condition with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves; ≈øo our Lord took our nature upon him, that he mighty pity us; he took fle≈øh and bloud upon him, he was tempted in all things like unto us, but without ≈øin, that ≈øo he might ≈øuccour tho≈øe that are tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: So his ≈øervants, many of them are much tempted, which may breed in them a ≈øympathy of affection to others, that are in ≈øuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</item>
                     <item>2. God will have it ≈øo, that <hi>Mini≈øters</hi> may have the more experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Truths they preach to others concerning an afflicted condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; tho≈øe that have had no <hi>≈øickne≈øs,</hi> or other <hi>affliction,</hi> cannot preach
<pb facs="tcp:62760:149"/>from experience of ≈øuch truths that concern ≈øuch a condition; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>preach</hi> ≈øo feelingly and ≈øavory as others; when they have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>affliction,</hi> they will know what <hi>affliction</hi> is, both in the nature of it, and the comforts of it, and Gods gracious a≈ø≈øi≈øtance therein, and ≈øo they may ≈øpeak comfortably, and be enabled to comfort others, as the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øpeaks.</item>
                     <item>3. God is plea≈øed ≈øo to order it ≈øometimes for their humiliation, to keep them low, that ≈øo they may not be lifted up by rea≈øon of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manife≈øtations and impartments; thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> had <hi>given him a thorn in the fle≈øh, the me≈ø≈øenger of Satan to buffet him, le≈øt he ≈øhould be exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above mea≈øure,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.7. <hi>A thorn was given him,</hi> &amp;c. ('tis twice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated both in the beginning and end of the ver≈øe) that ≈øo this thorn in the fle≈øh, might keep out pride in the heart, that ≈øo they may have a more low, meek, and humble frame of ≈øpirit, and thereby fitted and prepared for greater ≈øervices. And</item>
                     <item>4. That they may be al≈øo more conformable to tho≈øe they have to deal with. <hi>I≈ørael</hi> de≈øires <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> to ≈øpeak to them, (and not God) why? becau≈øe he was like unto them, and would therefore compa≈ø≈øionate them; from whom they therefore de≈øired to receive the commands of God. Thus it plea≈øeth God to deal with his ≈øervants, that as they may pity tho≈øe they have to deal with, ≈øo likewi≈øe to draw the affections of their people unto them, to make them more loving, and the more to attend on their Mini≈øtry, ≈øeeing they are ≈øo fleeting, and going away; it plea≈øeth God that <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> ≈øhould be ≈øick even to death, to endear the <hi>Philippians</hi> more to him, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.25, 28. that their love and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs may be drawn forth the more by di≈øcovery of his frailty. Let us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this.

            <p>Fir≈øt, In regard of the meanne≈øs; you mu≈øt not e≈øteem the Go≈øpel according to the Ve≈ø≈øel, according to the di≈øparagement of the Ve≈ø≈øel;
<pb facs="tcp:62760:150"/>a Ve≈ø≈øel of di≈øhonour, in re≈øpect of its matter, may be a Ve≈ø≈øel of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, in regard of the Gold that is in it; tho≈øe members of the body that are weak, and in them≈øelves le≈øs honorable, we afford a great deal of honor upon them, in deeking and cloathing them: So the Mini≈øters work and employment, and the Doctrines they bring, are excellent, and of great u≈øe; when all is done, we have that we ≈øerve for: accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the imployment we are put to, we are honorable, though out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly mean. Wicked and ba≈øe men are called <hi>Filii Terrae,</hi> they are Sons of the Earth, <hi>Job</hi> 30.8. <hi>Children of Fools, yea, Children of ba≈øe men; they are viler than the Earth, i.e.</hi> Men of no account (as one ≈øaith) the Earth groans under ≈øuch ungracious per≈øons; but gracious per≈øons are Ve≈ø≈øels of honor; as it was ≈øaid of the Giants of old, ≈øo it may be ≈øaid of the≈øe, <hi>They are men of Renown,</hi> and ≈øo we ≈øhall e≈øteem of them. Worldly men look at the out≈øide, and ≈øo e≈øteem of them; ≈øo was Chri≈øt dealt with, <hi>Is not this the Carpenters ≈øon?</hi> So tho≈øe Teachers in <hi>Corinth</hi> endeavoured to render Saint <hi>Paul his pre≈øence weak, and his ≈øpeech con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11. that ≈øo they might make his Mini≈øtry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible al≈øo. But this glorious Trea≈øure is in Earthen Ve≈ø≈øels; <hi>You know</hi> (≈øaith <hi>Paul</hi>) Gal. 4.13. <hi>that through infirmity of the fle≈øh, I preached the Go≈øpel unto you at fir≈øt:</hi> This was their commendation, <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>But my temptation which was in my fle≈øh, you de≈øpi≈øed not, nor rejected, but recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me as an Angel of God,</hi> even <hi>as Je≈øus Chri≈øt:</hi> All his weakne≈ø≈øes, and whatever was matter of di≈øcouragement, they did not de≈øpi≈øe, but honorably entertained him, even as Chri≈øt him≈øelf. So it was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the <hi>The≈ø≈øalonians,</hi> 1 <hi>The≈ø≈ø.</hi> 2.13 That <hi>they received not the word as the word of man, but</hi> (as it is in truth) <hi>the Word of God,</hi> looking to the mighty God to make it effectual; ≈øo ≈øhould all others do upon this con≈øideration.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Seeing Mini≈øters are Earthen Ve≈ø≈øels, in regard of moral infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which adhere to them, in re≈øpect of their corruptions and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øes judge of them as men, but e≈øteem of what is righteous in them; though they have great advantages again≈øt ≈øin, yet notwith≈øtanding, they are not totally exempted and free from ≈øin; as they are Mini≈øters, ≈øo they are men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In regard that Mini≈øters are Earthen Ve≈ø≈øels in re≈øpect of their frailty. Seeing then they are ≈øo frail and tran≈øitory, therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly you ≈øhould make u≈øe of them, deal kindly and affectionately with them, in that they are quickly broken. What is ≈øooner broken than a Gla≈øs, or an Earthen Ve≈ø≈øel? Mini≈øters are quickly taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and therefore you ≈øhould be tender of them while you have
<pb facs="tcp:62760:150"/>them. Where are all the Fathers? <hi>Do the Prophets live for ever?</hi> The Word of the Lord indeed indureth for ever, but the Preacher of it doth not; the Go≈øpel is eternal, but the Di≈øpen≈øer is mortal; the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is la≈øting, but the Mini≈øter is tran≈øitory; and therefore you ≈øhould carry your ≈øelves with all tenderne≈øs and re≈øpect to them: take heed of grieving their ≈øpirits, ≈øeeing they are ≈øo ≈øoon broken. Endeavour al≈øo to improve by them, and to get as much good as you can by them. It is a great argument, <hi>to work while it is day, becau≈øe the night comes, when no man can work:</hi> whil≈øt God affords means and opportunities, make u≈øe of them: we are but Pa≈ø≈øengers; therefore this is a great ground for you to get all the good you can by Mini≈øters, ≈øeeing they are frail.</p>
            <p>La≈øtly, By way of Improvement: Take notice of the wayes of God, as different from mans; God puts excellent Trea≈øure into <hi>Earthen Ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels:</hi> we keep trea≈øure in Strong Holds, in the ≈øtronge≈øt Repo≈øitories. Gods wayes are not as our wayes, he goes another way than we do; he makes u≈øe of the poore≈øt, meane≈øt, and mo≈øt frail Creatures ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; he layes a≈øide many times men of greater abilities, parts, and quality, and makes u≈øe of weaker to do this great work. <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtome</hi> makes an Expo≈øtulation, If it be <hi>excellent Trea≈øure,</hi> why in <hi>Earthen Ve≈ø≈øels?</hi> therefore it is a Ve≈ø≈øel of Earth, becau≈øe an excellent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure. Thus Gods wayes are un≈øearchable; this is the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Now be≈øides this interpretation given of it, there is another that will not be impertinent. Some under≈øtand by <hi>Earthen Ve≈ø≈øels,</hi> the Expre≈ø≈øions, Words, and Phra≈øes of the Mini≈øtry, through which the Doctrines and Truths of the Go≈øpel are conveyed; this is agreeable to what went before: Some fal≈øe Teachers in <hi>Corinth</hi> plea≈øed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves with eloquent and enticing words of worldly Wi≈ødom, and ≈øo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to render <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching de≈øpicable, in regard of the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of it: <hi>Therefore</hi> (≈øaith the Apo≈øtle) <hi>we have this Trea≈øure in Earthen Ve≈ø≈øels, i. e.</hi> familiar conveyances, that ≈øo we may ea≈øily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand it.</p>
            <p>Thus I have explained this <hi>Earthen Ve≈ø≈øel,</hi> and ≈øo have done with the fir≈øt con≈øiderable part, <hi>viz.</hi> the Di≈øpen≈øation it ≈øelf, <hi>This Trea≈øure we have in Earthen Ve≈ø≈øels:</hi> I come now to the ≈øecond, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p n="4">4.

Moral di≈øcour≈øes, though they be of great u≈øe, yet if we re≈øt in them, they leave us as they
<pb facs="tcp:62760:152"/>found us. Evangelical truths (which are manifold) are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the Mini≈øtry. Now as the matter of the Mini≈øtry mu≈øt be powerful, ≈øo the expre≈ø≈øion mu≈øt be powerful; there ≈øhould be ≈øuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blene≈øs of expre≈ø≈øion to the matter, <hi>i. e.</hi> with gravity, ≈øobriety, and affection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Strong lines make but weak preaching, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the efficacy: but delivering truths in the demon≈øtration of the ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and in power, that is mo≈øt effectual: when we ≈øpeak feelingly, and from our hearts, it comes then (through the ble≈ø≈øing of the Lord with it) with power. This is then to learn us of the Mini≈øtry, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. U≈øe.</p>
            <p>Let us be careful, that the matter of our Mini≈øtry be powerful, ≈øo that the handling and di≈øpen≈øing thereof be powerful, that ≈øo it may come home to the con≈øcience; thus we ≈øhould deal with all: <hi>The words of the wi≈øe are as goads, and as nails, fa≈øtened by the Mini≈øters of the A≈ø≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,</hi> &amp;c.

Many people are Sermon-proof, and think to ≈øtand out again≈øt the power of the Word; but if it comes in power to the con≈øcience, they will not be able to re≈øi≈øt it; as it is ≈øaid of them in the Go≈øpel, <hi>They were not able to re≈øi≈øt the Spirit by which he ≈øpake</hi> (viz. <hi>Stephen.</hi>) And for tho≈øe that de≈øire the conver≈øion of others, what cour≈øe ≈øhould be taken by them for that end? but by good coun≈øel, in≈øtruction, prayer, and good example, to endeavour them; and more e≈øpecially to bring them to the Word, and admini≈øtration thereof, which God hath ≈øanctified for this end.</p>
            <p>So much for the excellency of the Go≈øpel, <hi>viz. The excellency of the power,</hi> &amp;c. I come to the ≈øecond.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Author of it. 1. Po≈øitively, it is of God. And 2. Negatively, it is <hi>not of us.</hi>

            <p>Fir≈øt, Po≈øitively, it is of God, and that in all the con≈øiderations of it, in the full extent of it, it is of God. So the Mini≈øterial gifts, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of it, and the ≈øucce≈øs of it, are all from God.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Mini≈øterial gifts are from God, it is he that makes us able Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters of the New Te≈øtament; <hi>There are</hi> (≈øaith the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>diver≈øity of gifts; to one is given the word of wi≈ødom, to another the word of knowledge, by the ≈øame ≈øpirit,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4, 5, 6. It is God that be≈øtows every good gift.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:152"/>Secondly, The performance al≈øo is from God; his grace concurrs and a≈ø≈øi≈øts therein; the habit and the act are both from him; God gives gifts to men, and he enables them to di≈øpen≈øe them. Mini≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial employments are not onely for general, but particular applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and ≈øo need not onely general, but particular a≈ø≈øi≈øtances; <hi>That I might be enabled</hi> (≈øaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>to fulfill the work,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the Lord ≈øtood by me, and ≈øtrengthened me, that my preaching might be fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli≈øhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is God that makes the work powerful, efficacious, and ≈øucce≈øsful: Alas! when we have u≈øed our be≈øt endeavours, all the ≈øucce≈øs is from him, he mu≈øt make it effectual; it is ≈øaid, our Saviour went about doing good, for God was with him, enclining him to the work, and a≈ø≈øi≈øting him therein: So he is with all his ≈øervants; their griefs, employments, and ≈øucce≈øs thereof, are all of God, not of us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be objected: Is all from God, and nothing from us? Are we not ≈øaid to concurr with him? and is not then the power partly ours?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> I an≈øwer, No: 'Tis of God, and not of us; we are indeed ≈øubjects of the Mini≈øtry, the Recipients thereof; per≈øons employed in the work, and therefore are ≈øaid to be <hi>workers together with God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. But the power and efficacy thereof is from God alone: <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> were but Mini≈øters, <hi>'tis God that giveth the ble≈ø≈øing.</hi> It is not of us in two re≈øpects. 1. It is not merited by us, it is not of our de≈øerving, nor of our procuring. 1. It is not of our de≈øerving; the be≈øt, and mo≈øt accompli≈øhed, do not merit: <hi>I received a mercy</hi> (≈øaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>to be faithful:</hi> He accounted it a mercy to be employed, and to be faithful therein. 2. It is not of our own procuring, we do not obtain it by our own power; as <hi>Peter</hi> ≈øaid in the recovery of the lame man, <hi>It is not by any power and holine≈øs of ours, that this man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>s re≈øtored,</hi> &amp;c. And ≈øo it is not our gifts and indu≈øtry only, that will make our Mini≈øtry power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and therefore in this work let us be looking up to God, and de≈øire him to a≈ø≈øi≈øt us, as <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> ≈øaid, <hi>If thou goe≈øt not, O Lord, up with us, wherefore ≈øhould we go hence?</hi> So ≈øay I, if the pre≈øence of God be not with us, what can we do?</p>
            <p>And further, When we do partake of any mea≈øure of ability, ≈øee where we mu≈øt determine it: <hi>Not unto us, Lord; not unto us, but unto thy Name be all the glory.</hi> We mu≈øt not ≈øacrifice to our own Net, nor give the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to our own indu≈øtry, but wholly give prai≈øe to God, becau≈øe the excellency is of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But in the ≈øecond place, if you look upon the words reflexively,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:153"/>or as having their connexion to the words going before, and ≈øo agree and hold together, and thus you may read them: <hi>Therefore is this Trea≈øure in Earthen Ve≈ø≈øels, that the excellency of the power may be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be of God, and not of us:</hi> If it were in Angels, or had we never ≈øo ≈øtrong bodies, yet the excellency of the power of God would not be ≈øo clearly ≈øeen, as it is now, being laid up in poor frail Ve≈ø≈øels: Here is the power of God, here is the lu≈øtre and glory of God mo≈øt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øted; for ≈øo much the more apparently it will be ≈øeen to be from God, by how much the weaker the in≈øtrument is that is employed by God. Therefore if any thing doth act beyond its own power, it mu≈øt have ≈øome foreign powers for the producing ≈øuch and ≈øuch acts: therefore when we ≈øee any great matter done by poor frail and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible</hi> per≈øons of <hi>Earthen Ve≈ø≈øels,</hi> this doth plainly ≈øhew the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the power to be of <hi>God,</hi> and not of <hi>Man;</hi> therefore look from Man to <hi>God,</hi> it is <hi>God</hi> that doth the≈øe things; <hi>We ≈øhould over-look Earthen Ve≈ø≈øels;</hi> we ≈øhould (I ≈øay) over-look men that are the≈øe <hi>Earthen Ve≈ø≈øels,</hi> and look to <hi>God</hi> that makes the Mini≈øtry powerful in ≈øuch conveyances as the≈øe are.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, It may ≈øatisfie us of the Mini≈øtry, in that we are Ve≈ø≈øels, <hi>viz. men of frailty, &amp;c.</hi> We are apt to be di≈øcouraged; and to think hardly that we are followed with ≈øo many weakne≈ø≈øes, that we have a hard matter, that when we have taken ≈øuch pains in the work of the Mini≈øtry, we ≈øhould be thus rewarded: but this ≈øhould ≈øatisfie us, the more weakne≈øs in us, the greater honour will come to Chri≈øt: <hi>This Trea≈øure we have in Earthen Ve≈ø≈øels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.</hi> The weaker the Ve≈ø≈øel, the more honour will redound to Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, This may take off the ≈øervants of Chri≈øt from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingne≈øs unto tho≈øe works and performances which God calls them unto, by rea≈øon of their weakne≈øs: Thus it is when God call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> to any work or employment, the ≈øervants of God are apt to plead their own inability: <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> ≈øayes, he is not eloquent; <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ≈øayes, he is a child; <hi>Jonah</hi> ≈øays, he is a man of unclean lips. Thus we have their delays, their excu≈øes, whereby they endeavoured to di≈øcharge them≈øelves from that work that God call'd them unto, <hi>by their own weakne≈øs,</hi> &amp;c. But God refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes ≈øuch excu≈øes; <hi>for who makes the blind to ≈øee, and the dumb to ≈øpeak, but God?</hi> It is he that touched <hi>I≈øaiahs</hi> lips; it is he that ≈øaid to <hi>Jeremiah, Do not ≈øay, thou art a child, for I have ≈øent thee,</hi> &amp;c. This I ≈øay then is a con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may encourage Mini≈øters in their work, that the weaker they are, the more honour and glory will redound to Chri≈øt; <hi>for he ≈øaid unto me</hi> (≈øaith
<pb facs="tcp:62760:153"/>the Apo≈øtle) <hi>my grace is ≈øufficient for thee, for my ≈øtrength is made perfect in weakne≈øs.</hi> Not that it is an encouragement, or argument, for any to take upon them the great work of the Mini≈øtry, without ≈øufficient qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and abilities: But where there is not that degree of ability as is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øired, where there is a true ≈øen≈øiblene≈øs of their weakne≈øs, this may be an encouragement to them, that God delighteth to ≈øhew his power in them, that by ≈øo much the more they are weak, ≈øo much the more honour he will gain. For a conclu≈øion, it comes to this, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That we lay no ≈øtre≈øs upon any outward things.</p>
            <p>There is no ≈øtre≈øs or happine≈øs in the≈øe outward things; tho≈øe that ≈øeem to be of ≈øome concernment, as ≈øtrength of body, and other outward qualifications, that are of remark; yet con≈øider, they are fading and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitory; this ≈øhould teach us, in the enjoyment of outward things, a great deal of humility: though we are Ve≈ø≈øels of Gold, in regard of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure and improvement; yet in regard of our ≈øelves, we are Ve≈ø≈øels of Earth, and ≈øo ≈øhould be in re≈øpect of humility. Let us look upon all the≈øe things, as given to us of God, even for this very end, that we may be more ≈øerviceable to him, and his people.</p>
            <p>So I have done with the two general parts of the words, and ≈øo with the whole Ver≈øe, <hi>viz. We have this trea≈øure in Earthen Ve≈ø≈øels, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Do we begin again to commend our ≈øelves?</hi> (≈øaith the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1.) <hi>Or need we Epi≈øtles of commendations to us? Ye are our Epi≈øtle in our hearts,</hi> &amp;c. But this is applicable to the pre≈øent ≈øad occa≈øion now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</p>
            <p>This Reverend and ble≈ø≈øed man of God, Mr. <hi>James Nalton,</hi> was a Per≈øon of great note and eminency among us, and well known in this City, and in this place, where he ≈øpent his labour and pains many years. I could give large accounts and te≈øtimonies of him (if need were) from my own knowledge of him, having been acquainted with him many years. He was not only a Mini≈øter, but the Son of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter, his birth and education ≈øuiting together. He look'd upon it not only as an honour, but an engagement, to be careful to walk in tho≈øe ≈øteps ≈øet before him, and to continue the work of the Mini≈øtry begun by his religious Father. Certainly the Children of godly and holy Parents, cannot come off ≈øo cheap in their carriages, as others; they have greater accounts to make, as having greater examples ≈øet before them, greater advantages of Prayer, <hi>Exhortation,</hi> &amp;c. and ≈øo greater engagements; this was thought on, and ob≈øerved by him. And as he was the Son of a Mini≈øter, ≈øo when he came to years, and was ≈øitted, he
<pb facs="tcp:62760:154"/>took upon him the Mini≈øtry: as he was one of great abilities, ≈øo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly he di≈øcharged them faithfully and con≈øcienciou≈øly. He was a ≈øpiritual, powerful, con≈øciencious Preacher; he preached by his life: for as (<hi>Era≈ømus</hi> ≈øaith) we ≈øhould not only love to ≈øpeak truths, but we ≈øhould dige≈øt truths on our own hearts, before we commend them to others, and ≈øo they will be the more effectual. He was a man of a very meek, ≈øweet, and humble ≈øpirit; a man of a great humility, and of great meekne≈øs in the mid≈øt of great abilities, which was a great Ornament in him; a man full of tenderne≈øs and conde≈øcen≈øion to others; a man of a very yielding and melting frame of Spirit, ≈øoon di≈ø≈øolved into tears. It was the ≈øaying of one, that a good man is full of tears: ≈øo this good man was full of tears, not affected, but very real, and hearty, drawn from the fulne≈øs of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; as the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaith, he ≈øerved the Lord in much humility, and many tears. This was remarkable, that in the≈øe times our Reverend Brother was full of tears in delivering his Doctrine, which was ≈øuitable to the age we live in, being full of ≈øin and calamity; there is much need of a bewailing ≈øpirit to bewail the iniquities and mi≈øeries of the times; they that cannot bewail them≈øelves, need the tears of others. He was a man of great integrity, and ≈øingle-heartedne≈øs; in his exhortations he had much of the ≈øimplicity of Chri≈øt, as the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øpeaks. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Mini≈øtry, he had no worldly and ba≈øe affection, he had no carnal de≈øigns therein; but his chief de≈øign was to bring Souls home to Chri≈øt, that was his chief bu≈øine≈øs. What the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith of him≈øelf, may al≈øo be ≈øaid of him, that <hi>in ≈øimplicity, and godly ≈øincerity, he had his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øation in the world, not walking in craftine≈øs, nor handling the Word of God deceitfully, but by the manife≈øtation of the truth, commending him≈øelf to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mans con≈øcience in the ≈øight of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.2. He was a man had abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to ≈øpeak a word in ≈øea≈øon; he was very compa≈ø≈øionate to wounded ≈øpirits, he him≈øelf having been much afflicted. He was a man much in communication with God, and had much acquaintance with God, and was careful in improvement therein: He was a <hi>Jacob</hi> in wre≈øtling with God, a <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> that ≈øtood in the Gap, an <hi>Elijab</hi> that prayed earne≈øtly; the whole Land was the better for ≈øuch a per≈øon, being much with God; the made many addre≈ø≈øes to him, and had much holy familiarity with him. And as in his publick performances he was very faithful and beneficial, ≈øo in his Family and privately, he was very fruitful and ≈øerious. In a word (not to multiply much in this kind; you need it le≈øs in this Auditory, but only by way grateful memorial) there was much of God and Chri≈øt in him, and he was a great example to his fellow-≈øervants; there was much of <hi>this Trea≈øure</hi> (≈øpoken of in the Text) in this <hi>Earthen Ve≈ø≈øel;</hi> as,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:154"/>in the matter of it, he was one of a <hi>Go≈øpel Spirit;</hi> and in the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of it, he had great abilities for the work of the Mini≈øtry, and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged it with a great deal of ≈øucce≈øs. <hi>As he had this trea≈øure in an Earthen Ve≈ø≈øel,</hi> ≈øo his Ve≈ø≈øel, his frail body, was no di≈øparagement to him, but the advancement of the trea≈øure, in ≈øetting forth the power to be of God; his outward man was much weak and worn away, but his inward man was upheld by the grace of God. His fir≈øt work in the Mini≈øtry was in that place where my ≈øelf have relation to; he was an a≈ø≈øi≈øtant to my Predece≈ø≈øor (being then pa≈øt labour) Mr. <hi>Richard Couder,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the work ≈øo well, that he was exceedingly beloved of Mr. <hi>Couder,</hi> and well beloved of the Pari≈øh, and other places. He left a good impre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion behind, and I found good effects by the foundation there laid. The Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul</hi> indeed de≈øired not to work there where another had laid the foundation, but I thought it a great advantage that the foundation was laid by ≈øuch a Ma≈øter-builder. He was called into the Country to <hi>Rughy</hi> in <hi>Warwick≈øhire;</hi> there he continued very fruitful, and did much good. For ≈øome occa≈øion he removed, &amp; returned into the City, and came into this place, where he continued about 18 or 19 years, di≈øcharged the work of the Lord carefully: I need not ≈øay much of his carriage in this place, I appeal to your own con≈øciences. I may ≈øay of this ≈øervant of Chri≈øt, as the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaid of him≈øelf, 1 <hi>The≈ø.</hi> 2, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Ye are his witne≈ø≈øes, and God al≈øo, how holily, and ju≈øtly, and unblameable he behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf among you: as you know, how he exhorted, and comforted, and charged e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of you (as a Father doth his Children) that ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his Kingdom and Glory.</hi> Therefore there lies an engagement upon you to walk an≈øwerable to the truths he delivered, and to follow his ≈øteps, con≈øidering the end of his Conver≈øation: I ≈øhut up all in the words of the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> chap. 4. v. 9. <hi>Tho≈øe things which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and ≈øeen in him, Do: and the God of Peace ≈øhall be with you.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:62760:159"/>twenty things, as coun≈øel and advice from a dying man; and O that they may remain with you when I am dead. Fir≈øt, I ≈øhall give you ten by way of Caution; and ≈øecondly ten by way of Coun≈øel. My Cautions are:</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Beloved, I be≈øeech you, as you tender the welfare of your ≈øouls, take heed of breaking the Sabbath day, of prophaning the Lords day. It hath been ob≈øervable, that where ever Religion hath flouri≈øhed among any people, there they have ever been careful, and con≈øcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of the Sabbath day: And, on the contrary ≈øide, where Religion is gone to decay, and people grown to prophanene≈øs, there they are always loo≈øe on the Sabbath day. Pray remember, I hope you will remember, for God calls upon you, and commands you ≈øo to do, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 20. <hi>ver.</hi> 8.) <hi>Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.</hi> Do not you take ≈øo much liberty as ≈øome will give you. Who≈øoever you are that refu≈øe thus to do, I will leave this a≈ø≈øertion upon you, "Thou wretched man, hath "God given thee ≈øix dayes, and re≈øerved but one for him≈øelf, and "wilt thou rob him of that too? What if he had given thee but one, and kept ≈øix for him≈øelf, would you be ≈øo vile, as not to keep them? How much more then, when God hath given thee ≈øo much prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence in time. This is the fir≈øt, be con≈øcious in keeping the Sabbath day.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Take heed, and beware of Idolatry; this was <hi>Johns</hi> Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his beloved Children (1 <hi>Epi≈øt.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 21.) <hi>Little Children keep your ≈øelves from Idols.</hi> There is no ≈øin to which, nor no ≈øin by which we are more in danger, than Idolatry.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. There is no ≈øin to which we are in more danger, than Idolatry; Mo≈øes <hi>back was no ≈øooner turned, but the people made them a brazen Calf, and bowed down to it, and wor≈øhipped it as their brazen God,</hi> (Exod. 32. v. 4.) Jehojada <hi>was no ≈øooner dead, but</hi> Joa≈øh <hi>returned to Idolatry.</hi> If we were not prone this to ≈øin, what is the rea≈øon all the World turns Antichri≈øtians ≈øo univer≈øally?</item>
               <item>2. As there is no ≈øin to which we are in more danger, ≈øo there is no ≈øin by which we are in more danger, than Idolatry. I do confe≈øs if you will keep your garments clean, and undefiled with the mark of the Bea≈øt, it may be you may come under ≈øhrewd temptations; yet I entreat you as a dying man, as you love your ≈øouls, and for Gods ≈øake, flee from Idolatry, notwith≈øtanding your temptations that happen to you, he will ≈øupp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:62760:160"/>tempted above that you are able to bear, but will with the temptation al≈øo make a way to e≈øcape, that you may be able to bear it:</hi> Now ≈øee what u≈øe the Apo≈øtle makes of this promi≈øe; in the next Ver≈øe he follows with the≈øe words, <hi>Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from Idolatry, Seeing God will uphold us;</hi> let us with≈øtand any temptations, to this end, that God may uphold us. This is the ≈øecond Caution.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Thirdly, Take heed of Apo≈øtacy, of a degenerating back-≈øliding ≈øpirit, that you do not fall off from the truth and ground of the wayes of God, which ye have known and profe≈ø≈øed. It is is true, it may be for ≈øtanding to your Principles, you may lo≈øe the love of man; I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it may be ≈øo; but hear what God ≈øaith, <hi>If any man fall back, my ≈øoul ≈øhall have no plea≈øure in him:</hi> If thou goe≈øt on, mans ≈øoul may have no plea≈øure in thee; but if thou falle≈øt back, Gods ≈øoul will have no plea≈øure in thee: Thou doe≈øt by Apo≈øtacy declare to all the World, that thou ha≈øt made trial of the wayes of God, and thou do≈øt not find them to be as thou thoughte≈øt they were, nay, not ≈øo good as others. Oh, take heed of ≈øcandalizing the ways of God, hear how God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of tho≈øe that ≈øo do, (<hi>Jeremiah</hi> 2. and 10.) <hi>Go unto the I≈øles of</hi> Chittim, <hi>and behold, and ≈øend unto</hi> Kedar, <hi>and take diligent heed, and ≈øee whether there be ≈øuch a thing: Hath a Nation changed their Gods, which are yet no Gods? But my people hath changed their glory for that which will not profit. Hear, O Heavens, and be a≈øtoni≈øhed at this: for my people have committed two evils, they have for≈øaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed to them≈øelves broken ci≈øterns, that will hold no water.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is that would lead thee to Apo≈øtacy, beware, and fly from it, e≈øpecially evil company (of which I ≈øhall ≈øpeak more anon) let your love to Chri≈øt be augmented, and love of your ≈øelves aba≈øed; for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs you love Chri≈øt very much, and your ≈øelves very little, I cannot hope that you will ≈øtand to your Principles.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Beware of Covetou≈øne≈øs; it is Chri≈øts Caution (<hi>Luke</hi> 2. and 15. ver≈øe) <hi>Take heed and beware of Covetou≈øne≈øs:</hi> Here is a Caution, with a double Action, Take heed, and Beware. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, Brethren, it ≈øtands us upon ≈øo to do, for it ≈øteals upon us before we be aware of it; There is no per≈øon will deal more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriou≈øly with a Chri≈øtian, than a Covetous man will; He will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray his Life (if it were in his hands) into Enemies hands for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, as <hi>Judas</hi> did. A Covetous man will injure Chri≈øt in his
<pb facs="tcp:62760:160"/>Ordinances, he will not come at them, for the love he bears to the World will not ≈øuffer him; truly (quoth he) I have lo≈øt this, or that, while I was hearing a Sermon, I'le go no more, I mu≈øt ≈øtay at home, and look after my bu≈øine≈øs; I could give you many in≈øtances of this, but time will not give me leave; I ≈øhall only touch this one: What was it but the love of this World that kept tho≈øe who were bid to the Marriage Fea≈øt of the Great King of Heaven from coming? One had bought a piece of Ground, and he mu≈øt needs go ≈øee it; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother had bought Oxen, and he mu≈øt go to prove them; a Third had married a Wife, and therefore he could not come. Of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons in the World, a Covetous man cannot, nor will not endure to bear the Cro≈øs of Chri≈øt. (<hi>Philippians</hi> 3. ver≈øe 18.) <hi>For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you weeping, that they are the enemies of the Cro≈øs of Chri≈øt, who≈øe end is de≈øtruction;</hi> Who are the≈øe? what manner of per≈øons are they? why, they are ≈øuch who make their belly their God, who≈øe glory is their ≈øhame, and who mind earthly things. A covetous man he will lye, with <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira;</hi> he will ≈øteal, with <hi>Acha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> he will murther, with <hi>Aban;</hi> he will betray, with <hi>Judas:</hi> what will he not do, to attain his covetous de≈øire? This is the fourth, Beware of Covetou≈øne≈øs.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, You that have not taken warning yet, I be≈øeech you take warning now: Have a care and avoid evil company (<hi>Ephe≈øians</hi> 5.11.) <hi>Have no fellow≈øhip with the unfruitful works of darkne≈øs, but rather reprove them, and be ye ≈øeparated from them.</hi> Never go into a wicked mans company, if, before you go, you have not a probability of doing good, or getting good. Confider with thy ≈øelf, is there any likelyhhood that thou by thy whole≈øome reproofs mai≈øt do him any good; if there be, then go on; if not draw back, avoid them, flie from them, for their ≈øteps tend to perdition. By wicked company, the≈øe two things have been effected,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Good men made Bad.</l>
               <l>Bad men made Wor≈øe.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Good men have been made bad by wicked company. <hi>Jeho≈øaphat</hi> that good King, is an example of this, who by the company of wicked <hi>Ahab,</hi> was drawn to fight again≈øt tho≈øe whom God favoured, and to help <hi>Ahab</hi> in his wicked enterpri≈øe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:161"/>Bad men have been made wor≈øe by evil company: <hi>Ahab</hi> was made wor≈øe by the In≈øtigation of his wicked Wife <hi>Jezabel.</hi> Oh, can you bear when you are in their company to hear them bla≈øpheme the holy Name of God, and not reprove them? Truly, if you can, it is a ≈øign you are not ≈øo good as you ≈øhould be.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, My ≈øixth Caution is this: Oh, have a care of having the lea≈øt finger on your hand again≈øt a Saint; it is dangerous to have a thought, word, or act again≈øt the people of God; it is dangerous to have a thought ami≈øs of them, (<hi>P≈øal.</hi> 62.3.) <hi>They imagine mi≈øchief again≈øt a man,</hi> (that is, again≈øt a Saint) <hi>therefore they ≈øhall all be ≈ølain,</hi> for their bare imagination they ≈øhall all be cut off. It is dangerous to ≈øpeak again≈øt them, <hi>How dur≈øt thou</hi> (≈øaith God to <hi>Miriam</hi>) <hi>to ≈øpeak again≈øt my ≈øervant</hi> Mo≈øes? <hi>and immediately he ≈ømote her with a lepro≈øie as white as ≈ønow:</hi> it is dangerous to act again≈øt them; and it is forbidden by God, (<hi>P≈øal.</hi> 105.5.) <hi>Touch not mine Anointed, nor do my Prophets no harm.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you would ≈øay, you would not do them any harm, if you thought they were Gods people; Oh, but take heed le≈øt they prove Gods people, and then it were better for you, if a Mil≈øtone were hung about your neck, and you ca≈øt into the Sea, than to offend the lea≈øt of them.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Let me be≈øeech you all to take heed of complying with this ≈øinful World; whoever doth, do not you; but take up that good re≈øolution of <hi>Jo≈øhuah</hi>'s, <hi>As for me and my hou≈øe, we will ≈øerve the Lord. Though all el≈øe for≈øake God, yet will not I, yet let not us: I be≈øeech you</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>that you would not conform your ≈øelves to the fa≈øhions and manners of this wicked world.</hi> Oh take heed of conforming your ≈øelves to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øation of this world, but walk harmle≈øs, and ≈øhine as lights in the mid≈øt of a crooked and perver≈øe generation; if we will comply with the world, I mean, to be as mo≈øt of the world are, that is, temporizers, time-≈øervers, preferring the plea≈øing of Man before the plea≈øing of God, then we mu≈øt lye in wickedne≈øs, as all the World doth, (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.16.) <hi>For all that is in the World is either the lu≈øt of the fle≈øh, the lu≈øt of the eye, or the pride of life; and the≈øe are not of the Father, but abideth in the wicked one, the Prince of the power of the Air, after whom the men of the world walk.</hi> This is the ≈øeventh. Take heed of conforming your ≈øelves to this World.</p>
            <p>Eightly, Take heed of a ha≈øty ≈øpirit when you are under ≈øad di≈øpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øations; when you are under ≈øufferings you are apt to ≈øeek, and clo≈øe with relief, come it which way it will, and on what terms it will. Let me be≈øeech you Chri≈øtians, to have a care of ≈øuch a ha≈øty and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
<pb facs="tcp:62760:161"/>≈øpirit, (<hi>E≈øa.</hi> 26. ver≈øe 18.) <hi>He that believeth maketh not ha≈øte;</hi> that is, he maketh not ha≈øte to get out of his afflictions. The people of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> were of ha≈øty ≈øpirits, and murmured, becau≈øe they were kept ≈øo long in the Wilderne≈øs, for which God ≈ølew an innumerable company of them. <hi>Saul</hi> was of a ha≈øty ≈øpirit, and by it lo≈øt his Life and Kingdom. <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Mother no ≈øooner told him his Fathers intent, but he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved to have the fir≈øt ble≈ø≈øing, though he cheated his Brother, and lyed for it, and ≈øo told his Father that he was his elde≈øt Son; but he him≈øelf was afterwards deceived by a lye, with having the elde≈øt Daughter gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him in≈øtead of the younger. Take <hi>David</hi> for your example, he waited Gods time, the Kingdom was promi≈øed to him after <hi>Saul</hi>'s death, and when <hi>Saul</hi> pur≈øued him, you know <hi>David</hi> had him twice in his power, and with ea≈øe might have de≈øtroyed him, but he would not, <hi>Far be it from me</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>that I ≈øhould touch the Lords Annointed;</hi> let God ≈ømite him by the hands of his Enemies, I will not. It is far better to be Gods Bond≈ølave, than the Devils Freeman. Do not u≈øe any the lea≈øt action whatever, in any indirect way, to deliver thy ≈øelf, but patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øit down, and wait Gods good time, which, when once come, thy deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance will a≈ø≈øuredly come with it. Take heed then of a ha≈øty and ≈øul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len ≈øpirit under afflictions; ≈øome men, when God takes away any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from them, are of ≈øo ≈øullen a ≈øpirit, there is no pacifying of them: God will now this day take ≈øomething from you, which I believe you would willingly keep; will you therefore be of ≈øo ≈øullen a ≈øpirit, that, becau≈øe you cannot enjoy all, you'l not injoy any, but will rob your ≈øelves of all? What though you cannot enjoy your Mini≈øter any longer, will you not make u≈øe of the Ordinances of God? I be≈øeech you refrain this ≈øpirit, and let the deprivation of one mercy, be a means to make you make better u≈øe of tho≈øe that are left.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, My ninth Caution is this, Take heed of an ungodly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter; I ≈øpeak not to any mans per≈øon in particular, neither can I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe I know not as yet who will ≈øucceed me; but who≈øoever he be, if he be wicked, beware of him; for if he be ungodly, the people will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him; for, like Prie≈øt, like People: And I pray God deliver you from ≈øuch Mini≈øters, as for Doctrine, do teach the traditions of men; and cry Peace, Peace, when ≈øudden de≈øtruction hangs over their heads; Such Mini≈øters may plea≈øe you, but believe me they will never profit you; but at la≈øt you will find, that through the Vale of Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, you are led to the Pit of Perdition. They will tell you, you need not be ≈øo ≈øtrict and diligent in your conver≈øations; nor Heaven is
<pb facs="tcp:62760:162"/>not ≈øo hard and difficult to gain, as ≈øome would make you believe: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them not, but remember, <hi>that without holine≈øs none ≈øhall ≈øee God; and that neither Fornicaters, Adulterers, Idolaters, Thieves, Murtherers, Covetous per≈øons, Drunkards, Revilers, nor Extortioners, ≈øhall inherit the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tenthly and la≈øtly, Take heed you be not found profe≈ø≈øors of the Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel only. Chri≈øt, when he was preaching to a throng of people (as I am here this day) ≈øaid unto them, <hi>Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øees, which is Hypocri≈øie.</hi> Oh, that I had no cau≈øe to ≈øay, the leaven of the Phari≈øees is among you! I mean that there are many here that are but bare Profe≈ø≈øors! let me ask you that are only Profe≈ø≈øors this one que≈øtion; Is Religion good, or bad? If it be not good, what is the rea≈øon thou art not a≈øhamed to profe≈øs it? if it be good, what is the rea≈øon thou do≈øt but profe≈øs it? By thy bare profe≈ø≈øing, thou lo≈øe≈øt the love of Man; by no more than profe≈ø≈øing, thou can≈øt never gain the love of God; ≈øo that on all ≈øides thou art like to be mi≈øerable: The World will hate thee for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øo good, and God will hate thee for being no better. What a ≈øad thing is it, that thou lo≈øe≈øt thy comforts in this life, by profe≈ø≈øing ≈øo much; and thy comforts in the life to come, by no more than profe≈ø≈øing? Thus you have heard what I have to ≈øay by way of Caution: I ≈øhall now ≈øpeak to you by way of Coun≈øel. The former ten were Negative, the≈øe ≈øhall be Po≈øitive.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, I intreat you all, that above all things, you would mind the <hi>one thing nece≈ø≈øary:</hi> that you would not trouble your ≈øelves ≈øo much with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things of little concernment, but mind the great thing for which you came into the World. Oh my friends, will you ≈øpend your time for that which will not profit you, and your money for that which is not Bread? Look after Grace, labour to get an intere≈øt in Chri≈øt, of which you being unprovided, you will be undone for ever, &amp; it will be better for you, you had never been born: Oh! gain Chri≈øt, and then you will be fitted for all times, all troubles, and all conditions that can happen unto you; you will be endued with all wi≈ødom, and with all riches; if you gain not Chri≈øt, all that God doth to you, and for you, will nothing at all avail you.</p>
            <p>Secondly, My ≈øecond Advice and Coun≈øel unto you is this; That you would live, as you would die; live to day, as if you mu≈øt dye to morrow.
<pb facs="tcp:62760:162"/>Let me a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>k you, would you be content to dye in the ≈øtate you are in? If my Soul doth not de≈øire to be in a better ≈øtate when I come to dye, than now I am in, I may very well ≈øit down ≈øatisfied; if not, then ≈øurely it greatly concerns me to look after a better. Would any man be content to dye a Drunkard? I ask you that are Drunkards, I do believe you will an≈øwer no; why then do you live in Drunkenne≈øs? How know you that God will ≈øpare you when you are drunk, until you are ≈øober again? We may read of many that have dyed in their drunken fits. God doth not always ≈øend his Herauld to warn thee, before he ≈øends his Serjeant to arre≈øt thee. How knowe≈øt thou but Death may ≈øtrike thee on a ≈øudden? What will then become of thy Soul? Oh Beloved, I be≈øeech you live not in that you are unwilling to dye in. <hi>Balaam</hi> was not ≈øuch a Wretch, but he could cry our, <hi>Good Lord, let me dye the death of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Lay up for ≈øuffering times; there are few of you I believe are ≈øo bad husbands, but will lay up for a rainy day; I mean again≈øt a time of ≈øickne≈øs comes, wherein you will be unable to work; are you thus care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to maintain your bodies? and will you be carele≈øs of your ≈øouls? O be careful to provide for ≈øtormy weather; you have winter garments for your bodies to pre≈øerve them from cold, oh let patience be your winter garment, to pre≈øerve &amp; keep your ≈øelves warm in afflictions; I know that he that will live godlily in Chri≈øt Je≈øus ≈øhall ≈øuffer per≈øecution, and that through tribulations and ≈øufferings we mu≈øt enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; ≈øhall I not then provide for them? But you may ≈øay, What, doth per≈øecution attend all the godly? A man may e≈øcape them, as well as ≈øuffer them? Put ca≈øe afflictions ≈øhould not come, thou wilt be never the wor≈øe for being provided for them; for he that is fit to dye, is fit to live; &amp; that man that is fit to ≈øuffer afflictions, is fit to live without them. It was <hi>Paul</hi>'s Exhortation to the <hi>Ephe≈øians</hi> 6.10. <hi>Finaly, my Brethren, put on the whole Armour of God, that ye may be able to with≈øtand the wiles of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> And it is wi≈ødom in a man, to provide for a mi≈øery before it comes. There is mention made of a Nation (the <hi>Spartans,</hi> I think) that u≈øeth to chu≈øe their King, as we do our Lord Mayor, every year, &amp; whil≈øt they are in their annual Government, they lived in all abundance of ≈øtate, have all the fulne≈øs their hearts can wi≈øh; but when their year is over, all their pomp &amp; glory is over too, &amp; they bani≈øht into ≈øome ob≈øcure remote place for ever, where they ≈øpent the remainder of their lives in great want and mi≈øery. One King (knowing this) being called to rule over this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, made ≈øuch u≈øe of his time wherein he reigned as King, that by his provident living, he heaped up ≈øo much trea≈øure, and ≈øent it before him
<pb facs="tcp:62760:163"/>to the place where he knew he ≈øhould be ≈øent, as maintained him all his life time. Thus it is, God hath appointed to every one a time to live in, and that bur a ≈øhort time too; and in that time he hath appointed afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to attend us, if we will live godlily in Chri≈øt Je≈øus; it is not wi≈ødom in us then to provide for them? Take heed then, to avoid ≈øufferings, you do not commit ≈øin; to commit ≈øin, to avoid ≈øuffering, is as if a man ≈øhould run our of the mouth of a barking Dog, into the mouth of a devouring Lyon; What is the wrath of man to the wrath of God? Man can but de≈øtroy the body, and no more; but God can de≈øtroy both body and ≈øoul into Hell fire to all eternity.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, My fourth word of Coun≈øel and Direction is this, Be ≈øerious in ≈øerious things; when you come to perform ≈øerious things, do them ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riou≈øly. I do not know that ever I ≈øaw a man fall a≈øleep while he was tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Money, for if he ≈øhould, how could he tell whether it were right or no? Yet alas! too too many ≈øleep when they ≈øhould be taking Truth, not only by natural ≈øleep, but al≈øo by ≈øpiritual ≈øleep; they are ≈øo carele≈øs in receiving the Word they hear, and ≈øo lazy withal, that rather then they will try the Word they hear, they will take all for truth the Mini≈øter tells them. Beloved, I believe you will ≈øcarce put ≈øo much confidence in a man, as to receive a ≈øumm of Money without te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ling it, becau≈øe he ≈øaith it is right; and yet will you receive all that your Mini≈øter tells you is truth, for truth, without trying it? You mu≈øt not be ≈øluggi≈øh in your work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for God, but put forth your ≈øelves to the uttermo≈øt: You mu≈øt make the Kingdom of Heaven ≈øuffer violence, and take it by force. But then.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The fifth Direction which I ≈øhall give you is about hearing the Word, how you mu≈øt behave your ≈øelves when you hear. I take it for granted you will hear, I hope you will; for brown bread is better than none, and a little is better than none at all; yet I intreat you take the≈øe two words of Direction.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Fir≈øt, Try the Word you hear by the Truth.</item>
               <item>Secondly, Try your ≈øelves by the Word.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Try the Word you hear by the Truth; if it be not con≈øonate to that, believe it not, let who will preach it. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> ≈øo to do, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 1.8, 9) <hi>But though we, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                  </gap> an Angel from Heaven, preach any other Doctrine unto you, than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accur≈øed.</hi> How <hi>Paul,</hi> accur≈øed? ≈øure you ≈øpeak too high; what if an Angel, mu≈øt he be accur≈øed? ≈øure you will call in your words again: Nay, in≈øtead thereof, he repeats them over again, <hi>As we ≈øaid before, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>o I ≈øay again; If any one preach any other Go≈øpel, than that which you have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:163"/>let him be accur≈øed.</hi> If any man pretend a Revelation from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and cannot bring Scripture for what he ≈øaith, do not believe one ≈øyllable. Take the noble <hi>Beraeans</hi> for your Example; they would not believe <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine, until they had ≈øearched to ≈øee whether it were ≈øo or no.</p>
            <p>But then, as you are to try the Word you hear, by the Truth; ≈øo try your ≈øelves by the Word: You hear as a Truth, that <hi>there is no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to them that are in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, who walk not after the fle≈øh, but after the Spirit.</hi> Now try your ≈øelves by this Truth, and ≈øee whether or no you walk after the Fle≈øh, or after the Spirit: I have likewi≈øe two Directions about the preaching of the Word.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Do not you receive the Word for the per≈øons ≈øake that brings it. I am apt to think that many of you will receive a Truth of one mans bringing, which you would not receive of anothers: and thus ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Word of God with re≈øpect of per≈øons, which you ought not: But fir≈øt, receive the Word for its own ≈øake; and ≈øecondly, receive the Per≈øon for the Words ≈øake, (1 <hi>The≈ø≈ø.</hi> 5.12, 13.) <hi>We be≈øeech you, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to know them which a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e over you, to admoni≈øh you, and labour among you in the Lord, and to e≈øteem of them very highly in love, for their works ≈øake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, My Direction in the ≈øixth place, ≈øhall be concerning the Times we live in; and I ≈øhall tell you how you ought to behave your ≈øelves, in two particulars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Fir≈øt, Blame thy ≈øelf mo≈øt, that the Times are ≈øo bad; there is a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral complaint about the ≈øadne≈øs of the Times, but no particular; every one puts the cau≈øe away from him, and in≈øtead of accu≈øing them≈øelves, are alwayes accu≈øing others: <hi>Ahab</hi> he ≈øaid to <hi>Eli≈øha,</hi> thou art he that troubled <hi>I≈ørael; Eli≈øha</hi> ≈øaid unto <hi>Ahab, Thou art be that troubled</hi> I≈ørael; <hi>Adam</hi> ≈øaid to God, <hi>The woman which thou gave≈øt me, did give to me, and I did eat:</hi> the Woman ≈øhe ≈øaid, <hi>the Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>:</hi> Thus do we put it off from our ≈øelves to others. No man ≈øaith with <hi>Jonas, E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap> my fake is this come upon you,</hi> I am the cau≈øe of all this; no man ≈øaith, what have I done? Would you have the Times mend? Oh, then every ≈øoul of you condemn your ≈øelves, and amend your wayes; the Times would not be ≈øo bad, if we were not ≈øo bad: would you have the effect cea≈øe, then ≈øeek to remove the cau≈øe. But then</item>
               <item>Secondly, Pray not ≈øo much for better Times, as for better Hearts; for had you never-≈øo-good Times, and not good Hearts, your ble≈ø≈øings would be cur≈øings; good Times without good Hearts, will but fatten you the ≈øooner to the ≈ølaughter.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:164"/>Seventhly, If you cannot do the good you would, then do the good you can; many people are ≈øo ≈øullen, that becau≈øe they cannot do all they would do, they will do none at all. I be≈øeech you be not of this temper; what though you cannot ≈øerve God in publick, will you not therefore ≈øerve in private; why may you not do as S. <hi>Au≈øtin</hi> was bid to do; <hi>(<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>olle loge)</hi> take up and read? This will be a reading and praying time with you; and now you cannot hear as formerly you have done, Oh, pray more, and read more; and the le≈øs you have in publick, the more you may have in private; you may read and pray, we are not forbidden that yet; let us then make u≈øe of them.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, My intreaty is unto you all, That you would be careful and circum≈øpect in your conver≈øation, (<hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 5.15, 16.) <hi>See then that ye walk circum≈øpectly, not as fools, but as wi≈øe, redeeming the time, becau≈øe the dayes are evil.</hi> Walk as becometh the Profe≈ø≈øors of the Go≈øpel, and labour to be blamele≈øs towards God and Man. Oh, what notice will there be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, when any Profe≈ø≈øor doth but ≈ølip a≈øide, and do any thing ami≈øs; it is the joy of wicked mens hearts to ≈øee it, and how diligently do they watch for it, and often wi≈øh it? We have a Proverb, <hi>That one man may better ≈øteal a Hor≈øe, than another look on:</hi> I am ≈øure a wicked man may better commit ≈øeven ≈øins, than a Profe≈ø≈øor one: For it is the failings, the bad lives of Profe≈ø≈øors, that makes Religion ill ≈øpoken of, and hinders many a weak ≈øoul from clo≈øing with it: Sure think they, their Religion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be good, their Conver≈øations are ≈øo bad: Let us therefore be wary and careful in all our actions.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Mourn, and lament for the ≈øin you cannot hinder. It was ≈øaid of <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>t,</hi> (2 <hi>Peti</hi> 2.8.) That his righteous ≈øoul was vexed with the wicked Conver≈øations of the <hi>Sodomites.</hi> Oh, that we were but ≈øo good as we ≈øhould be, then ≈øure it would grieve us more than it doth, to ≈øee the wicked and abominable lives of tho≈øe among whom we live: Though thou do≈øt not bla≈øpheme God thy ≈øelf, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>et it is thy God that is bla≈øphemed, and ≈øhall not that trouble thee? How can≈øt thou but reprove them whoever they be? When a ≈øick man ≈øeeth his Wife, Children, Friends, and Phy≈øitian, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting his condition, ≈øure it will make him think his condition is wor≈øe than he thought it, or very bad at lea≈øt, or el≈øe why do they take on ≈øo, if there was no cau≈øe of fear? Thus, it may be, thy reproof may work upon a wicked man; If when thou heare≈øt him bla≈øpheme God, thou lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øt his condition, and puts him in mind of his ≈øad e≈øtate, it may make him lay that to heart then, which he never did before.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, The la≈øt thing that I have to be≈øeech of you, is, That you would love one another: I have not at all ≈øought to pro≈øelyte you to my
<pb facs="tcp:62760:164"/>way, but whatever you ≈øee in whoever it be, that is of God; Oh, love it, be he of what profe≈ø≈øion he will, he is a godly man: O then love him; you cannot love God, if you do not love his people; Let brotherly love con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.20.) <hi>If any man ≈øaith he loveth God, and hateth his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he is a lyar, and the truth is not in him: For if he loveth not his Brother whom he hath ≈øeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ≈øeen? We believe,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>John</hi> in the next Chapter, <hi>That Je≈øus Chri≈øt is the Son of God, and he that loveth the begetter, mu≈øt al≈øo love him that is begotten.</hi> You would be loath to do otherwi≈øe in civil bu≈øine≈øs: Will you refu≈øe commerce with a man, becau≈øe he is contrary to you in opinion, becau≈øe he is not a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of our City? Be not then ≈øo far from loving one another, as to bear hatred one to another.</p>
            <p>Thus you have heard what I had to ≈øay unto you by way of Caution and Coun≈øel: O that they may make ≈øuch impre≈ø≈øions on your hearts, that they may be your continual practice in your lives and conver≈øations. I ≈øhall now clo≈øe with the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (2 Cor. 13.11.) <hi>Finally, Brethren, farewel; be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace, and the God of love and peace ≈øhall be with you.</hi> And the Lord grant, that both ye and I, when we come to the Judgment-Seat of God, render up our account with joy, and receive an immortal Crown with Chri≈øt in Heaven; until which Day, I be≈øeech Almighty God to keep you, and pre≈øerve you in his fear. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               </bibl>
               <q>Mo≈øt gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Chri≈øt may re≈øt upon me.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>FRom this Text, you had this Truth, That a <hi>Chri≈øtians chiefe≈øt glory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his infirmities, is in the power of Chri≈øt re≈øting upon him.</hi> In the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øecution of this Point, there was the≈øe four particulars propounded to be opened and pro≈øecuted.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, <hi>What kind of power of Chri≈øt it is, which Chri≈øtians may hope to have experience of, notwith≈øtanding all their infirmities?</hi> To this que≈øtion it was thus an≈øwered: a power that Chri≈øt hath with his Father, with whom he is extraordinarily prevalent more than the fondling is with his deare≈øt affectionate Mother: A power of Chri≈øts which enables us to do what God requires, and to ≈øuffer what God commands: a powerful Application of Je≈øus Chri≈øt him≈øelf unto his people, and that, not
<pb facs="tcp:62760:166"/>only of light to them, but of living, of ≈øpiritual growth, of ≈øpiritual ≈øtrength, of ≈øtrength unto conque≈øt, yea, to be more than Conquerors.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>What is it for the power of Chri≈øt to re≈øt on the Soul?</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>i. e.</hi> for the power of Chri≈øt to come, and take its re≈øidence in the Soul: to make the Soul to be that which a Tent or Tabernacle is to him, who takes up his repo≈øe therein; to come and lodge in the Soul of a Believer, as in his Tent or Tabernacle.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>What is it for a Believer to glory in the power of Chri≈øt re≈øting on him?</hi> That is,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. To have the heart ≈øo full of Chri≈øt, that it cannot contain it ≈øelf, but it mu≈øt be bur≈øting out, as it were, and running over in holy Exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Triumphs.</item>
               <item>2. To be ≈øo much in the admiration of Chri≈øt, as that, to a carnal eye, it makes a man ≈øeem to be ridiculous: what a goodly per≈øon was <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Michols</hi> eye, when he danced before the Ark.</item>
               <item>3. To re≈øt on Chri≈øt ≈øo, as to look out for nothing el≈øe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate and confine all the de≈øires of the Soul, in and upon, and towards Chri≈øt Je≈øus.</item>
               <item>4. To oppo≈øe Chri≈øt to any, to every thing, that doth any way in the world, either enjure, or endanger him.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Why ≈øhould a Chri≈øtian rather glory in this power of Chri≈øt re≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him, than in any inherent grace that is given unto him?</hi> Upon the≈øe Accounts.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Becau≈øe all that a Chri≈øtian by inherent grace is able to do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, is through Chri≈øt: <hi>I can do all things through Chri≈øt that ≈øtrengthens me.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. Becau≈øe if there be any acceptance of what a Believer doth with the Father, this al≈øo is through Chri≈øt: the gift is accepted, not for the gifts ≈øake, but for the ≈øake of the Merit of Chri≈øt.</item>
               <item>3. If ≈øo be a Believer ≈øhould glory in his graces, there is a po≈ø≈øibility of falling, but being clad with, and re≈øting in the power of Chri≈øt, there's an impo≈ø≈øibility of mi≈øcarrying. Thus the Saints of God have their infirmities, frailties, their multitude of frailties and infirmities; yet have they rea≈øon to glory in that power of Chri≈øt which re≈øts on them on Earth, but much more rea≈øon, if they will look up, and ≈øee the tongue of Chri≈øt engaged for them, <hi>i. e.</hi> interceding for them, in Heaven: And that lets me into</item>

            <p n="1">1. A <hi>Gla≈øs,</hi> a notable one: that's two-fold, a <hi>dead Gla≈øs, Water;</hi> a <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Gla≈øs, the Heart of a Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:168"/>2. The <hi>Object</hi> to be ≈øeen in the≈øe Gla≈ø≈øes: in the dead Gla≈øs, the <hi>face of man</hi> is to be ≈øeen; in the living Gla≈øs, the <hi>heart of man;</hi> there's all the Species and Complexions of the Sons, nay, of the Souls of the Sons of Men, to be ≈øeen. That as by looking into the Water, you may di≈øcern your own, and other mens countenances, and that plainly and clearly; So, by looking into your own hearts, if you could have a Ca≈øement into the hearts of other men, there may you ≈øee of what <hi>Spiritual Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Con≈øtitution,</hi> and <hi>Make</hi> you are, as clearly as a man may ≈øee his face in water. <hi>As in water,</hi> &amp;c. From the≈øe words, this great Truth, that <hi>the Heart of every man in the world is a Looking-gla≈øs.</hi> 'Tis ≈øuch a Looking-gla≈øs, wherein he may ≈øee him≈øelf, his Condition, Con≈øtitution, ≈øpecial Complexion, whether it be Morally, Spiritually, Scripturally, Good or Evil. For the right improvement of this Looking-gla≈øs, three things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary, which are optick Principles, but clear to tho≈øe that have either Phy≈øical, or Natural Light.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There mu≈øt be an <hi>Object</hi> that mu≈øt be ≈øeen. And oh! what vi≈øible Objects are there in the hearts of men? Man is called a little World, a Compendium of the whole World: The heart of man, is the Man. The heart of man, is like the <hi>Ark</hi> of <hi>Noah,</hi> which contains all ≈øorts, all kindes of clean and unclean Bea≈øts: 'Tis an Epitomy of Heaven and Hell What is there in the heart of man? Who but God can fathom the depth of it? There are more Objects in the hearts of men, than Stars in Heaven, or drops in the Ocean.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There mu≈øt be light to actuate this Object, if it were dark, we could never ≈øee it. There mu≈øt be light both to actuate the eye and object. Now this light that actuates the eye and object, 'tis either the <hi>natural light,</hi> the light of <hi>Nature,</hi> the light of <hi>Con≈øcience,</hi> the light of <hi>common Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,</hi> the light of the <hi>Word,</hi> or the light of the <hi>Spirit of God:</hi> By all the≈øe Lights we come to look into the Looking-gla≈øs, our Hearts.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There mu≈øt be an <hi>Irradiation from the Object, i. e.</hi> a beaming forth from that Object, ≈øome Species or Idea's that carries the object to the eye, and clearly makes out to the ≈øen≈øe what that Object is, this beam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is by action from the heart; mark it (for it may be as nece≈ø≈øary truth as was preached among you) that look what the Stream is to the Fountain, what the Beam to the Sun, that the action is to the heart, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the act be manent, or tran≈øient; whether <hi>Internal</hi> in thought, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe, election, a≈ø≈øection, in joy, in love, in fear: Or <hi>External,</hi> in the life, in the practice, and in the conver≈øation. So that look as a puddle Stream always declares a corrupt Fountain, ≈øo all your humble, holy, faithful thoughts ≈øpeak a clear ≈øpiritual heart within; a holy conver≈øation ≈øpeaks
<pb facs="tcp:62760:168"/>a holy Affection; and a holy Affection, declares a heavenly Con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a new Nature. Now for the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øe</hi> of this, is the heart of a man a Looking-gla≈øs?</p>
            <p n="1">1. See from hence, of what concernment the Actions of men are, whether internal or external: The actions of men are like the ≈øtreams, you may certainly finde the Fountain by them; they ≈øpeak the heart, as the Root bears the fruit. 'Tis of infinite concernment, 'tis the Fountain of what principles within, and conver≈øation without: de≈øcend but into thy own heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This ≈øhews the ≈øad condition of all <hi>natural poor ≈øouls,</hi> your Hearts are Looking-gla≈ø≈øes; but they are Looking-gla≈ø≈øes in a dungeon of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs; there be Toads, Vipers, and Devils there, but thou can≈øt not ≈øee them that ha≈øt no ≈øpiritual Light.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Here is con≈øolation to Gods people; Is the Heart of a man a Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-gla≈øs? What rea≈øon have they to rejoyce in their hearts, that are the be≈øt Looking-gla≈ø≈øes in the world, not like our <hi>Gallants</hi> Looking-gla≈ø≈øes that mu≈øt not bewray their wrinkles, ≈øpots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But theirs will repre≈øent their Heart, Complexion, Condition, and Nature to them; Nay, in that Gla≈øs may be ≈øeen the face of a God: Nay further, becau≈øe thy Heart doth an≈øwer to another Heart, and his to his, whatever Grace is in any Believers, it is there in thy Heart, in <hi>≈øemine;</hi> there's the ≈øeed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By way of exhortation; Is the Heart a Looking-gla≈øs? Then keep the Looking-gla≈øs very chary, make much of it; above all keepings keep thy heart, and that <hi>with all diligence, in all places, at all times,</hi> and in <hi>all things?</hi> If any thing under Heaven will keep thee holy, it is the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thy Heart: There thou maye≈øt ≈øee all thy ≈øpots, defects, de≈øperate Hypocri≈øies, Infernal Athei≈øm, all the deliques of thy ≈øoul: How prone to commit as vile <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Once more, keep it <hi>clean,</hi> and keep it <hi>clo≈øe:</hi> Look into the heart, and thou ≈øhalt finde it to be a Copy of the Role of Eternity, where thou ≈øhalt ≈øee thy very name written in Letters of Gold or Bloud: for we looking into our Hearts, may, and do know, that we are pa≈ø≈øed from death to life, and that upon this ground, <hi>becau≈øe we love the brethren.</hi> And thus I advance to</p>

                  </gap> ≈ølit into the≈øe two particulars.
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>That every Believer may have an a≈ø≈øurance of his Tran≈øition from death to life.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>The love of the brethren is one of the great eminent Symptoms of mans Regeneration.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>A Chri≈øtian may know his real Conver≈øion, and Tran≈ølation to eternal life.</hi> Such a great and real change is there wrought in every Believer at his Conver≈øion; and this wrought by ≈øuch a great Efficient and Infinite cau≈øe, the Spirit of God; and this cau≈øe, working by ≈øuch real and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful means, and in≈øtruments, the great Word of God; and this done, notwith≈øtanding the great oppo≈øition that is made by a poor ≈øinner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the Word: and when wrought, it hath ≈øuch a real and grand ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon a Believer, that 'tis impo≈ø≈øible but a Believer mu≈øt needs know this his Tran≈øition from death to life.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Love to the brethren is the great Symptom of mens Regeneration. Love to the brethren,</hi> not taken <hi>≈øolely, ≈øingly,</hi> as if this was the onely Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, but <hi>concomitantly</hi> taken with others, but beyond, and above all others, this is the Privie Soul of God on the Soul, if he have inflamed it with love, <hi>he may know he is pa≈ø≈øed from death to life.</hi> The <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øe is of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation</hi> of the <hi>Papi≈øts,</hi> tho≈øe grand enemies to Go≈øpel-Truths, and Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers peace. They abhor this Doctrine of A≈ø≈øurance: by it, their <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> would fall down, their <hi>Popes</hi> Kitchin would grow cold. They tell us, Believers cannot have a≈ø≈øurance in this World: No?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Why hath God <hi>commanded</hi> us to make our <hi>Calling</hi> and <hi>Election</hi> ≈øure?
<pb facs="tcp:62760:169"/>and will God command Impo≈ø≈øibilities, ≈øuch as cannot be wrought by our, or his own power?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Other Saints have attained this A≈ø≈øurance, this New Name, and White Stone within them.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>That's by extraordinary Revelation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈ø.</hi> This is not upon proof: Was not the a≈ø≈øurance of Gods people in Scripture grounded upon <hi>general promi≈øes?</hi> Had they (many of them) either extrin≈øecal ≈øigns, or marks to a≈ø≈øure them of it? did it not ≈øpring from Principles, common to all Believers?</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But ≈øuppo≈øe they have a≈ø≈øurance to day, they may lo≈øe it to morrow? Man is a mutable Creature, he may be a childe of God in the morning, and a brat of Hell in the evening.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> 'Tis true, man is a mutable Creature, yet is he pre≈øerved by an immutable God: Man is a weak Creature, but yet is pre≈øerved by the power of God unto ≈øalvation: Man, as a <hi>Creature,</hi> is no le≈øs mutable in <hi>Heaven</hi> than upon <hi>Earth;</hi> there pre≈øerved by God, therefore why not here?</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>This is a Doctrine that tends to loo≈øne≈øs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Not ≈øo: It did not work loo≈øne≈øs in <hi>Paul, Job,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I laboured more than they all.</hi> Nothing under heaven ≈øo ≈øoveraign to ≈øtave off, and pre≈øerve from lu≈øt, as the a≈ø≈øurance of Gods love to the Soul. Such a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurance comes from the highe≈øt act of Faith; and one of the great things of Faith, is, to purifie the heart and life.

            <p>GOd hath ≈øpoken once, yea twice have I heard this, That power belongeth to God. When God is plea≈øed to ≈øtrike twice upon the ≈øame ≈øtring, it ≈øeems he hath ≈øomething more than ordinary mind, that you ≈øhould ob≈øerve the turn. The Doctrine was, <hi>That it is the will of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, that his ≈øervants ≈øhould continue in the world, though they meet with nothing but trouble in the world. I pray not that thou ≈øhoulde≈øt take them out of the world:</hi> let them ≈øtay Lord, be thou but their <hi>Pilot,</hi> and then keep them at <hi>Sea</hi> as long as thou wilt. God knows his Saints are very ≈øerviceable in their generation: They are as it were, a Pillar of fire unto the re≈øt of the world for guide and light: By their Doctrine and Conver≈øation, they in≈øtruct the godly, and convince the wicked: God will have his people ≈øtay in the World, that his power, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, mercy and goodne≈øs in their pre≈øervation may more clearly be di≈øcovered; that their afflictions here may work out for them an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal weight of glory.

               <item>3. Though this be the ca≈øe of fallen man; yet poor creature he ≈øees it not.</item>
               <item>4. The very <hi>Formalis Ratio</hi> of ≈øin, that wherein the <hi>Formality</hi> of ≈øin con≈øi≈øts, is in this, not ≈øo much in finning again≈øt God by outward Acts, as in the hearts departing from God.</item>

                  <hi>Rev. 2.17.</hi>
               </bibl>
               <q>To him that overcometh, will I give to eat of the hidden Manna.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>TO him that overcometh, i.e.</hi> Not that hath by one, two, or more acts conquered; but to him that Overcomes, that hath, and doth, and is overcoming ≈øtill, that goes on conquering and to conquer.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To him that overcomes thus, and this way, and this Enemy, this greate≈øt Enemy that God hath, Truth hath in the World: <hi>Antipas</hi> e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, that keeps my Truth inviolable, that in a Scriptural way oppo≈øes that greate≈øt Enemy I have, and oppo≈øes him to a conque≈øt. <hi>To him that overcomes,</hi> that goes on to overcome, that thus overcomes. Hence this Ob≈øervation; <hi>Believers are all a generation of Conquerours,</hi> all Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; they are all like the Sons of Kings, but ≈øome Believers are more Conquerours than others; ≈øome that lay Antichri≈øt upon his back, ≈øuch as out-≈øhoot the Devil in his own Bow, that ≈øtand out again≈øt Satans greate≈øt Batteries, that turn his Cannon on him≈øelf, and cuts off the head of that <hi>Goliah</hi> with his own ≈øword: The≈øe are ≈øomething more than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours.

            <list>
               <item>1. With ability to di≈øcern all nece≈ø≈øary, heavenly my≈øteries, and this enables them to overcome <hi>Antichri≈øt,</hi> as he is an erroneous, fawning, Heretical Prophet.</item>
               <item>2. With a power to believe all things, even ≈øuch things, as though they do not contradict, yet exceed the reach of Rea≈øon.</item>
               <item>3. With a power to do all duties, I can do all things through Chri≈øt that ≈øtrengthens me. The≈øe Conquerours cannot do any thing again≈øt, but any thing for the Truth.</item>
               <item>4. With a power to ≈øuffer all things. The≈øe Conquerours are ready, not only to be bound, but to ≈øuffer, to die, for the Name of Je≈øus, and to conquer by dying.</item>
               <item>5. With a power to for≈øake all things. To look upon all things, as dung and dro≈øs, that they may win Chri≈øt.</item>
               <item>6. They have not only a power of might, but of right too, as Kings conquer, &amp;c. But what means are to be u≈øed to overcome in the ≈øen≈øe of the Text.</item>

            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> 1. Study well that little Book of the <hi>Revelations;</hi> indeed the Book of Books, the Book of Sacred Scripture, in which we have at once the ≈øum of the Saints duty and priviledge, and of Gods care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb facs="tcp:62760:177"/>over his Church in the latter dayes of the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Concoct this Book by a practical belief of what is revealed in it, do not think your own Notions to be Divine Revelations.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Familiarize the Cro≈øs of Chri≈øt, dye daily in <hi>expectation</hi> of it, and <hi>provi≈øion</hi> for it; do not ≈øay, (as <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.17.) <hi>I ≈øit as a Queen, and ≈øhall ≈øee no ≈øorrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Labour, by a pro≈øpect of Faith, to antedate tho≈øe great joyes <hi>God</hi> hath prepared for tho≈øe that ≈øo ≈øuffer, as to conquer.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Buckle on the whole Armour of God, and above all, leave not out the Shield of Faith.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Let your Love abound higher by oppo≈øition. That becomes a <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> ≈øpirit indeed. The more the wind blows it in thy face, let that blow up more of thy blood into thy face; Let it warm thee more, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Live not by Example, but by Rule; Tho≈øe that follow the mo≈øt, whither go they? <hi>Wide is the gate, broad is the way, that leads to Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and many there be that enter therein. The flock</hi> of <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> is a <hi>little Flock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. E≈øteem duty above ≈øafety. As one, It is nece≈ø≈øary <hi>Rome</hi> ≈øhould be ruined: it is not nece≈ø≈øary I ≈øhould be pre≈øerved. 'Tis nece≈ø≈øary Religion ≈øhould be advanced, the power of godline≈øs pre≈øerved; it is not nece≈ø≈øary I ≈øhould be in this or that condition.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Indulge not the lea≈øt ≈øin el≈øe, thou wilt never be <hi>Conquerour.</hi> That-man that will not lay down his <hi>Lu≈øt</hi> for <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> will never lay down his <hi>Life</hi> for <hi>Chri≈øt.</hi> A man can never be re≈øolved for Chri≈øt's ways without, if not re≈øolved again≈øt all impurity within.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Harden, and anoint your ≈øelves with practical improvement of Chri≈øt's ≈øufferings, in Chri≈øt's death. There was an e≈øtimable price to purcha≈øe our Conque≈øt, an infinite merit to ≈øtrengthen, to encourage our Conque≈øt; an all-≈øufficient virtue to cau≈øe our Conque≈øt, a pledge of our eternal Conque≈øt; we are Conquerours already, we do but gather the Spoil. Make u≈øe of Chri≈øt's death as the merit, pattern; and motive of your Conque≈øt.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Labour for Sincerity.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Get well acquainted with Divine Attributes, and Divine Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes: And ≈øuch e≈øpecially as may be mo≈øt ≈øuitable for your condition.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Abhor the <hi>relicks of ≈øuper≈øtition:</hi> The very Ne≈øt; and the very Cage of the Bird is unclean: Not a crum of that old Leaven, it will ≈øowre the whole lump: <hi>Antichri≈øt</hi> is hugely like the Devil, let him get in but one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="14">14. Get an experimental knowledge of Go≈øpel-Truths; they are your Head-Profe≈ø≈øors, that turn Apo≈øtates.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Let this be your fir≈øt and chiefe≈øt care, your fir≈øt and la≈øt, to ≈øeek and ≈øerve God: Which if you do, as all other things, ≈øo this priviledge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øt ≈øhall be added unto you as your Crown: <hi>Seek ye fir≈øt the Kingdom of God, and the righteou≈øne≈øs thereof, and all the≈øe things ≈øhall be added unto you;</hi> Which opens the door to</p>

               <item>1. <hi>The Object; The Kingdom of God;</hi> the Kingdom of Heaven, and its Righteou≈øne≈øs.

            <p>IN the≈øe words you have the Manner, Matter, and Effect of <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching. The <hi>Manner,</hi> why <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>rea≈øoning;</hi> the <hi>Matter,</hi> it is of righteou≈øne≈øs, temperance, and judgment to come; the <hi>Effect, Felix</hi> trembled. Fir≈øt, For the manner of <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching, <hi>as he rea≈øoned,</hi> i. e. as he argued the matter, he did propound it in a rational way, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øued it before <hi>Felix;</hi> and this he doth in a double capacity, as he is a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,</hi> and as he is an <hi>Apo≈øtle;</hi> as a <hi>Chri≈øtian,</hi> and as a <hi>Preacher.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. As a <hi>Convert</hi> and <hi>Chri≈øtian,</hi> and ≈øo he had rea≈øon to do, and make u≈øe of that rea≈øon he had to ≈øhew; though he became righteous, yet <hi>Paul</hi> had not lo≈øt his rea≈øon. Hence learn, true Religion will con≈øi≈øt with right Rea≈øon. Ble≈ø≈øed be God for his truth. We are apt to look upon men as mad men, if they will be righteous. It is true, before <hi>Paul</hi> was converted, he had rea≈øon, but he u≈øed it madly; but after conver≈øion, he begins to be ≈øober, and make the be≈øt u≈øe of his Rea≈øon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Look upon <hi>Paul</hi> as a <hi>Preacher,</hi> ≈øo he makes u≈øe of his rea≈øon. And true rea≈øon may, and mu≈øt be u≈øed in preaching the Go≈øpel, yet with the≈øe two Cautions.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Do not over-value Rea≈øon, do not lift up the Servant above the
<pb facs="tcp:62760:180"/>Ma≈øter; Prize <hi>Grace</hi> more than <hi>Rea≈øon: Piety</hi> is better than <hi>Parts;</hi> though <hi>Parts</hi> are the <hi>Ring of Gold, Piety</hi> is the <hi>Diamond</hi> in that <hi>Ring.</hi> As if a man in a Pulpit ≈øhould come to ≈øhew what a brave Scholar he is, this is to over-value Rea≈øon.</item>
               <item>2. Do not under-value Rea≈øon. We have had a ≈øtrange fancy, that if a man that could not read Engli≈øh, would but come and talk, and preach to us, he was farr more de≈øirable than a <hi>Black-coat</hi> that hath been at the <hi>

This Learning hath ≈øpoiled all the World; do you not know how many Scholars are Athei≈øts, and their Learning made them the wor≈øe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is not the fault of their Rea≈øon, had they more Rea≈øon they would improve it the better. It is want of Rea≈øon that makes them not crucifie their Lu≈øts. Becau≈øe corrupt men many times abu≈øe that which is good, will you therefore ca≈øt it off?</item>
            </list>
            <p n="2">2. For the <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching: And here ob≈øerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1.

                  </gap>tions, and con≈øtitutions.</hi> A man in the <hi>Pulpit</hi> ought not to ≈øhoot at random. <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øpeaks <hi>ad rem</hi> to his hearers, ≈øuitably tells them of righteou≈øne≈øs, temperance, judgment to come.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Con≈øider it with relation to his <hi>Scope,</hi> which was to bring them unto Chri≈øt; and what doth he do? He preaches Grace, Mercy; and Peace; no, not a word of that, but <hi>Righteou≈øne≈øs, Temperance, Judgment to come. Paul</hi> was a convincing Preacher, he knows his way to bring home <hi>Felix</hi> and <hi>Dru≈øilia</hi> to Chri≈øt, was fir≈øt to convince them of their ≈øin, and the wrath of God due to ≈øin. The whole ≈øum of <hi>Pauls</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was by way of conviction. Sin and mi≈øery mu≈øt be preached for this end, that it may bring men unto Chri≈øt. We mu≈øt not make them half dead, and there leave them, but bring them to the Chirurgion; all our conviction is only for this end, that you might be brought to Chri≈øt, by grace to glory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For the <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching; <hi>Paul</hi> preached, and <hi>Felix</hi> trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; doth not <hi>Dru≈øilla</hi> tremble? 'Tis more than probable ≈øhe brought <hi>Paul</hi> to preach there, that <hi>Dru≈øilla</hi> had a months mind to hear what he had to ≈øay; but <hi>Felix</hi> trembled. Hence ob≈øerve, <hi>The≈øe that are fir≈øt in enjoying, may be la≈øt in receiving the Go≈øpel.

<pb facs="tcp:62760:181"/>
               <hi>Felix,</hi> that ≈øerved the Devil in ≈øtead of God, trembled, but not ≈øhe. Back≈øliding profe≈ø≈øors from the truth, are infinitely farther from melting under the Go≈øpel, than prophane Sinners, that never heard of it. A man had farr better go to preach to <hi>Heathens,</hi> than <hi>Apo≈øtates.</hi> Then for the words, <hi>Felix trembled.</hi> Why? there was <hi>Righteou≈øne≈øs</hi> pro≈øecuted and convinced, <hi>Judgment to come</hi> threatned again≈øt him. Now his knees began to ≈ømite together, now the writing on the Wall, now <hi>Felix</hi> trembles. Oh poor ≈øoul! would≈øt thou not tremble at the preaching of Judgement to come? ≈øubmit to the Judge before he come; would≈øt thou not have thy Judge to condemn thee then? let him be now thy King to rule, thy Prophet to in≈øtruct, thy Prie≈øt to reconcile; would you avoid the terrour of a Judgment to come? accept of this offer of a Chri≈øt coming; coming did I ≈øay? nay, he is come already: Do but lay your ear clo≈øe to the third of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and the twentieth, you ≈øhall hear your Judge knocking.

            <p>FRom this Ver≈øe we may ob≈øerve three Doctrines:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Peoples eyes mu≈øt be taught by the Mini≈øters holine≈øs of life, as well as their ears by the Mini≈øters ≈øoundne≈øs of Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> did not preach one thing, and practice another; he <hi>practi≈øed</hi> as he preached, and he both practi≈øed and preached the <hi>fore-mentioned</hi> Duties in the ver≈øe before the Text. And to this end the Lord <hi>appointed</hi> a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øtry to be perpetuated through all Ages of the World: And it is the Lords appointment, that the peoples ears ≈øhould be taught with ≈øour'd Doctrine, to the matter and manner of it: and it is the Lord <hi>appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that the Peoples eyes ≈øhould be taught by the Mini≈øter, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of life, as well as their ears, by their ≈øoundne≈øs in Doctrine; and this is nece≈ø≈øary for the Mini≈øter him≈øelf, and nece≈ø≈øary for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: No marvel then that a faithful Mini≈øtry is the Butt of the Devils
<pb facs="tcp:62760:183"/>malice, of his craft and cruelty; and that the Devil hath in all Ages at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted and endeavoured utterly to overthrow the Mini≈øtry, or to poy≈øon and fly-blow it ≈øhamefully; and this is the method whereby Satan hath endeavoured to fly-blow the Mini≈øtry. Why, then ≈øee the folly and madne≈øs of tho≈øe people, who affect, or cry up tho≈øe Mini≈øters, who do not teach their people with ≈øound Doctrine, or a holy life; and whether there be no ≈øuch Mini≈øters, which do not teach their peoples eares with ≈øoundne≈øs of Doctrine, or their eyes with a holy life? and whether there be not ≈øuch a people as do cry up ≈øuch Mini≈øters? and whether or no ≈øuch people are not guilty of ≈øpiritual folly and madne≈øs? judge ye.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> A Mini≈øters ≈øoundne≈øs in Doctrine, and holine≈øs of Life and Conver≈øation, doth lay a very great obligation on a people, to a due con≈øcientious practice of every commanded duty. The Apo≈øtle, we ≈øee, maketh his Preaching and Practice an argument to excite the <hi>Phillippians</hi> to the fore-mentioned commanded duty, as in the Text, and the ver≈øe before the Text.</p>
            <p>As fir≈øt of all, the Appellations and Titles given in Scripture, to ≈øuch Mini≈øters who≈øe Doctrine is ≈øound, and who≈øe lives and conver≈øations are exemplary holy.</p>
            <p>They are called, 1. <hi>The Salt of the Earth,</hi> as <hi>Math.</hi> 5.13. read that, ≈øaith Chri≈øt to tho≈øe great Teachers of the Go≈øpel, and Di≈øpen≈øers of his Oracles, and in them to their Succe≈ø≈øors. Salt hath two things in it; namely, Sharpne≈øs, and Savourine≈øs; and thus Mini≈øters, Fir≈øt, mu≈øt rebuke ≈øharply, that people may be ≈øound in the Faith, as <hi>Paul</hi> enjoyns <hi>Titus,</hi> as in the 1. of <hi>Titus,</hi> and 13. ver≈øe. And ≈øecondly, Mini≈øters mu≈øt ≈øpeak ≈øavoury things to every per≈øon, and to every palat, that their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may be ≈øavoury both in heart and life; but to be as un≈øavoury as ≈øtinking Carrion in the No≈øtrils of the Almighty God, under ≈øuch a ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury and ≈øea≈øoning Mini≈øtry, this is woful. It is the nature of Salt, to cau≈øe barrenne≈øs where it ≈øea≈øoneth not; Therefore we read of <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi> in <hi>Judges</hi> 9. ver. 45. That be <hi>≈øowed the City with Salt:</hi> So that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who live under a ≈øharp and ≈øavoury Mini≈øtry, and are not ≈øea≈øoned therewith, and pre≈øerved from putrefaction in their ≈øin and corruption thereby, their ca≈øe is very dangerous.</p>
            <p>They are called again, <hi>The Light of the world,</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.14. read that. As for their Doctrine, <hi>The Salt of the Earth;</hi> ≈øo for their lives, <hi>The Light of the world;</hi> and they mu≈øt therefore lead convincing lives, as <hi>Job.</hi> 5.35. read that: It is there ≈øaid of <hi>John the Bapti≈øt,</hi> our ble≈ø≈øed Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour gives him this commendatory Character, or Te≈øtimonial, <hi>That he
<pb facs="tcp:62760:183"/>was a burning, and a ≈øhining light;</hi> burning in him≈øelf, and ≈øhining to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Or, as it was ≈øaid of <hi>Ba≈øil, Thundring in his Doctrine, and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in his Life and Conver≈øation.</hi> Now if good <hi>Mini≈øters</hi> be the Light of the World, then hence we may inferr,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Inference.</hi> Fir≈øt, That without a godly, and faithful <hi>Mini≈øtry,</hi> the World lyeth in darkne≈øs, ignorance, error, ≈øin, and mi≈øery. It is ≈øaid of <hi>Galilee,</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.16. <hi>That the people that ≈øate in darkne≈øs, ≈øaw great light;</hi> read that. Why, had they not Prie≈øts and Levites? I an≈øwer, They had indeed ≈øorry Prie≈øts, but they had not a faithful Mini≈øtry; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Evangeli≈øt tells them, <hi>They ≈øate in darkne≈øs,</hi> yea, <hi>in the region and ≈øhadow of death,</hi> notwith≈øtanding the ≈øorry ≈øotti≈øh Prie≈øts they had: But when they had a faithful <hi>Mini≈øtry,</hi> they are ≈øaid to ≈øee a great light. Again, if good Mini≈øters be the Light of the World, then we may draw this Corollary, That to be offended at the Light of a faithful, a powerful Mini≈øtry, argues and ≈øpeaks a very ≈øinful and wretched frame of heart. Nothing is ≈øo excellent, but ≈øome will be di≈øplea≈øed at it, and with it, as <hi>Eccle≈ø.</hi> 11.7. Even the Light it ≈øelf, we know is offen≈øive to ≈øore eyes. And thus the burning and ≈øhining Light of a godly and faithful Mini≈øtry is offen≈øive and terrible to ≈øome; but who are they? Sore di≈øea≈øed ≈øouls, the Lord knows. The Ark of God, which was the monument of his pre≈øence, whom did it ≈ømite with Emrods, but the Phili≈øtims? What then, is the Ale-hou≈øe more ea≈øie to thee, than thy Pew is to thee, in this place? than a Con≈øcience, Soul-≈øearching Sermon? What art thou offended at a powerful faithful Mini≈øtry? Oh fearful Plague-to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens!</p>
            <p n="2">2. To do all that men can do to put out the Light, this is wor≈øe. It is the mo≈øt horrid helli≈øh Plot that can be de≈øigned or named; and of this I am ≈øure the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot plead Not Guilty, which, like the Scribes and Phari≈øees take away from the people the Key of Knowledge, and ≈øhut up the Kingdom of Heaven again≈øt men. How terribly doth our ble≈ø≈øed Lord thunder-≈øtrike tho≈øe ≈øtupid <hi>Phari≈øees</hi> for this, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.13? And as did the Phari≈øees, ≈øo did the Papi≈øts: For,
<list>
                  <item>1. Heretofore they made it a moral ≈øin to read Gods Word.</item>
                  <item>2. Afterwards, they clogged the liberty they granted with ≈øuch <hi>cautions</hi> and <hi>re≈øtrictions,</hi> as that very few e≈øcaped of tho≈øe that were within the reach of the Inqui≈øition.</item>
                  <item>3. Tho≈øe cloggs contented not, but now it is thought fit utterly to deny liberty, and can there be a more horrible helli≈øh Plot <hi>a≈ø≈øigned</hi> than this? to take from people their knowledge of ≈øalvation?</item>
               </list> And thus the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whether they have Church-≈ønuffers or not, to be ≈øure they have Church-extingui≈øhers, and various means to put out the Light; Oh fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb facs="tcp:62760:184"/>is this! as in <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19, 20. <hi>That is the rea≈øon men hate the light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe their deeds are evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, If good Mini≈øters be the light of the world, then hence may we draw this Conclu≈øion, That it concerns people very nearly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the light, and to walk in the light, and to work while the light la≈øteth; as our ble≈ø≈øed Savior exhorteth in <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.35, 36. read that. God ≈øets up his Mini≈øters as Lights, as Candles, on the Candle≈øticks of his Church, to awaken men, and to light men unto eternal life: And ought not people to pray hard, and to work hard while the light la≈øteth? God removes many times the Candle and Candle≈øtick, and makes the Sun to go down at Noon-day, as <hi>Amos</hi> 8.9. ≈øo darkens the Earth at clear day. Good Mini≈øters they are called the light of the world, and they are called.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Stars, as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.1. And who are meant by the ≈øeven Stars, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. <hi>ult?</hi> they are the Angels, that is, the Mini≈øters of the ≈øeven Churches. Now the Stars are ≈øaid to affect tho≈øe inferiour bodies:
<list>
                  <item>1. By their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence. And thus godly and faithful Mini≈øters, by the influence of their lips, they feed many with the bread of life.</item>
                  <item>2. By their regular motives of their lives, they confirm many.</item>
                  <item>3. By the light of both they confirm many.</item>
               </list> One while their employment is to in≈øtruct poor ≈øouls, and ≈øo they are like ≈øtars ≈øhining in a dark winter-night; Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while they are to conver≈øe in their cour≈øes, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.20. Now to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy and live under the Mini≈øtry of ≈øuch Stars, and yet to walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and to have fellow≈øhip with the works of darkne≈øs, to remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convineed, unconverted, unhumbled, unmortified, unfruitful, this is woful, this is a very lamentable ≈øtate.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They are called the Lords <hi>Me≈ø≈øengers</hi> and <hi>Emba≈ø≈øadours, Mal.</hi> 2.7. and the Mini≈øters of the Go≈øpel; for indeed the Mini≈øters of the New Te≈øtament they are no where called Prie≈øts, they are called <hi>Emba≈ø≈øadors</hi> for Chri≈øt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. Godly, faithful Mini≈øters are the Lords <hi>Me≈ø≈øengers</hi> and <hi>Emba≈ø≈øadours</hi> in matters concerning the ≈øoul, the precious, immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, never-dying ≈øoul of man, not in the matters of this life, but for the ≈øoul. Now this is no mean imployment to treat with God for the Soul.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They are called the Lords Husband-men. Gods Church is his Husbandry, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9. and Mini≈øters are Gods Husbandmen; naturally we are like a barren Wilderne≈øs; Now the Lord ≈øends his Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to tho≈øe barren Wilderne≈ø≈øes, to make a fruitful Paradi≈øe: Now for Gods Husbandmen to plow, ≈øow, and harrow, and yet no fruit, no crop, <hi>I≈øa</hi> 5.6, When Gods Vineyard brought forth no fruit, <hi>I will take away all their rainy clouds,</hi> ≈øaith God, you ≈øhall have clouds, but you ≈øhall
<pb facs="tcp:62760:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>have clouds without rain; you ≈øhall have Mini≈øters ≈øtill, but ≈øuch as ≈øhall never do your ≈øouls any good.</p>
            <p>Well, you ≈øee the Titles given to them in Scripture; they are called the Salt of the Earth, and the Light of the World, and Scars, and the Lords Me≈ø≈øengers and Emba≈ø≈øadors, and Husbandmen; all which doth import a very great obligation lying on a people, who live under ≈øuch a Mini≈øtry, and who live under, and practice every commanded duty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Inference.</hi> Secondly, Dangerous and fearful is the ≈øtate of tho≈øe, who have enjoyed, and lived under, and have not been wrought upon by ≈øuch a Mini≈øtry. And this will appear, if we con≈øider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. How fearful a ≈øentence the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt hath given to tho≈øe that live under, but de≈øpi≈øe, and profit not by the Mini≈øtry of his faithful Servants, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.14, 15. And do not think that <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> ≈øaid this touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Mini≈øtry of the Apo≈øtles onely, certainly the Lord Chri≈øt would have it to be under≈øtood of the Mini≈øtry of all his faithful Servants, whom he ≈øendeth to teach his people, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.20. whom≈øoever he ≈øends; and ≈øo, <hi>He that de≈øpi≈øeth whom ever I ≈øend, de≈øpi≈øeth me.</hi> Then is the Me≈ø≈øage of the Lords faithful Me≈ø≈øengers received aright, when people do not only hear it, but receive it, and bring forth fruit, as our ble≈ø≈øed Lord ≈øpeaks of good hearers, <hi>Mark</hi> 4.20. Tho≈øe are they that hear and receive the fruits ≈øown in good ground. And thus our ble≈ø≈øed Lord expounds him≈øelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.24. he telleth us there, that they of <hi>Capernaum</hi> ≈øhall be in a wor≈øe ca≈øe than they of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah;</hi> and why? becau≈øe they repented not at Chri≈øts Sermons and Miracles; they were not to be ≈øeen in their lives, notwith≈øtanding <hi>Chri≈øts</hi> Mini≈øtry, notwith≈øtanding <hi>Chri≈øts</hi> preaching, and his mira<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p n="2">2. If a People be not wrought upon by ≈øuch a Mini≈øtry, what hope can ≈øuch a People have, that any thing ≈øhould do their ≈øouls any good?

Oh men do hinder the fruit of the Word in their own ≈øouls, the powerful operation and working of the Word on their own ≈øouls! The Lord prophe≈øies that ≈øentence on the Jews, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.14. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What then, ha≈øt thou not <hi>profited</hi> under the Mini≈øtry of the Lords faithful Servant? Oh lay the blame on thy ≈øelf.</p>

Now to enjoy, and not to enjoy, is it not a <hi>fearful ≈øign,</hi> that you are not of God? as <hi>John</hi> 8.47. Is it not a ≈øign, that thou are not of Gods elect, at lea≈øt of Regeneration? But you will ≈øay, Did not the <hi>Jews</hi> hear Gods Word? Yes, they did, with their bodily ears; but they heard it not with ≈øaith, ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion, and fruitfulne≈øs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our ble≈ø≈øed Savior tells them, they were not of <hi>God,</hi> that is, they were at lea≈øt in an unregenerate, if not in a reprobate condition.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is no breach of the Churches peace, no argument of a contentious and unquiet ≈øpirit in a Mini≈øter, to ≈øpeak vilely of vile Mini≈øters, and enemies of the Churches peace.</hi> Why, who are they? <hi>John Bapti≈øt</hi> tells us, he calls them <hi>Vipers, a generation of Vipers:</hi> why, were they not Preachers? <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.7. And will you ≈øay that <hi>John Bapti≈øt</hi> was a man of a contentious Spirit, of an unquiet Spirit? And who were they whom our ble≈ø≈øed Saviour calls a <hi>Generation of Vipers? Mat.</hi> 12.34, 38, 39. And who were they whom our Saviour calls a <hi>Generation of Vipers, and an evil and Adulterous Generation?</hi> were they not <hi>Preachers?</hi> and it is very ob≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:189"/>both <hi>John Bapti≈øt,</hi> and our Saviour did call tho≈øe Preachers thus, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the hearing of them who were their ordinary hearers; and do but ob≈øerve what ≈øtrange terms of di≈øgrace St. <hi>Peter</hi> gives them, 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.12. to certain Preachers in his time, ver≈øe 14. what ≈øtrange terms doth the Apo≈øtle give to tho≈øe Teachers, who≈øe pernicious wayes many would follow, as in ver≈øe 2. of that Chapter. But did not the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øees ≈øit in <hi>Mo≈øes</hi>'s Chair? and did they not preach ≈øome good Doctrine? in≈øomuch that <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt</hi> bids the people hear them, and ob≈øerve what they ≈øaid, though not what they did, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.1, 2, 3. Therefore may ≈øome ≈øay: It ≈øeemeth ≈øtrange that <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> ≈øhould thus di≈øgrace the Scribes and Phari≈øees; was not this the way to make their Mini≈øtry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible?</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, It is very clear and undeniable, that there was a Generation of pitiful ≈øorry Teachers, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.36. Why, did not the people en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Teaching of the Scribes and Phari≈øees; yes, they did; but the Scribes and Phari≈øees were Idol-Shepherds, they knew how to feed their Flock, and therefore Chri≈øt lookt on the people as Sheep ≈øcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, for all the Scribes and Phari≈øees. They did not under≈øtand that there was heart-murder, or heart-adultery, until our ble≈ø≈øed Saviour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructed them: The Scribes and Phari≈øees, they did but ≈øtrike at the bough only, but our Saviour <hi>Preached with authority, and not as the Scribes did.</hi> And withal, I an≈øwer,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That beyond all peradventure, our ble≈ø≈øed Saviour ≈øaw, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Scribes and Phari≈øees did teach ≈øome truths, yet by their Life and Doctrine they did more mi≈øchief than good; and therefore the more credit they had among the people, the more mi≈øchief they were like to do: And therefore from hence our ble≈ø≈øed Lord and Saviour calls them a <hi>Generation of Vipers.</hi> But I hope you will not count it an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the breach of the Churches peace, to ≈øpeak vilely of a vile Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtry; It was no more than <hi>John Bapti≈øt</hi> did, and than our Saviour did.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, No mans ≈øin de≈øerves ≈øo ≈øharply to be reproved, as the ≈øins of Mini≈øters; becau≈øe his ≈øins of all others, are the chief ≈øins committed in a Land; at the Sanctuary of prophanene≈øs too too often begins.</p>
            <p>Therefore when Gods people met in their publick Fa≈øts, they made ≈øolemn Confe≈ø≈øion of tho≈øe ≈øins of the fir≈øt Magnitude, by which they had mo≈øt provoked the Lord; they do make Confe≈ø≈øion chiefly of the ≈øins of their Magi≈øtrates and Mini≈øters, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.33, 34. The <hi>Jews</hi> there bewailed the ≈øins of their Magi≈øtrates and Mini≈øters, as the particular cau≈øe of their plagues. Oh the ≈øins of Teachers are the Teachers of ≈øin, and therefore no mans ≈øin de≈øerves to be ≈øo ≈øharply reproved, as the ≈øcandalous ≈øins of Min i≈øters. Now if you love your ≈øouls, take heed
<pb facs="tcp:62760:189"/>and beware of a prophane, delight in lewd, loo≈øe, di≈ø≈øolute Mini≈øters. We ≈øind the Lord complaining of the wickedne≈øs of the Prophets, and of the Prie≈øts and People, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 5 <hi>ult.</hi> the people, did take a prophane delight in fal≈øe Prophets, and in polluted Prie≈øts; and ≈øo likewi≈øe in the Prophet <hi>Micah, chap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 11. the people, although they did oppo≈øe the Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> and other true Prophets, yet they did approve of and delight in fal≈øe Prophets, ≈øuch as were of their own leaven, their own way and mould, ≈øuch as would flatter them, and promi≈øe them wine and ≈øtrong drink: and are there not many ≈øuch people in the world, that had rather hear ≈øuch a Mini≈øter, than ≈øuch as preach clo≈øe-walking with God, and of getting to Heaven under pain of damnation? Will you cry up, and will you prophanely delight in a Mini≈øtry that ≈øhall preach peace, peace to all prophane rebellious people; in ≈øhort, ≈øuch a one that will poi≈øon you in Doctrine, or in his example.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Take heed and beware of a ≈øinful Idolizing of godly, faithful Mini≈øters; the Apo≈øtle decries this with much zeal, ardency, and ≈øervency of Spirit; what is <hi>Paul</hi>'s planting, and what is <hi>Apollo</hi>'s watering? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5, 6. As excellent gifts, parts, and graces as the≈øe men had, yet they look higher: ≈øo it is your duty to look above mens parts, and above mens gifts and graces; <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> cannot give increa≈øe; <hi>Paul</hi> indeed may plant, but there is no rooting indeed in the≈øe plants, but by chri≈øt. And read <hi>v.</hi> 7. It is God and he only that can give encrea≈øe: As <hi>Eli≈øha</hi>'s Servant could carry his Ma≈øters ≈øtaff and lay it on the dead child, but the child could not be rai≈øed to life, until <hi>Eli≈øha</hi> came him≈øelf; thus godly faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters can but lay Gods Me≈ø≈øage before you, but unle≈øs the Lord ≈øet it to the heart, never a dead Soul can be rai≈øed from the death of ≈øin, to the life of grace and holine≈øs. Remember godly and faithful Mini≈øters, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have the Lords Sword, yet they have not the Lord Chri≈øts arm; and alas, what can the Lord Chri≈øts Sword do without his Arm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Take heed of being leavened with prejudice again≈øt the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øtry of the Word, becau≈øe of the mi≈ødemeanours or mi≈øcarriage of the Mini≈øter. Surely the efficacy of the Word and Sacrament doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the quality of the Mini≈øter. It is the Word of the Lord that converts, not the per≈øon of the Di≈øpen≈øer or Speaker. A ≈øeed that is fown in a good ≈øoyl, may, yea will grow and thrive, although perhaps the Sower had a very dirty hand, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.2, 3. The Apo≈øtle tells the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> that they are, ≈øaith he, <hi>The Epittle of Chri≈øts Mini≈øtry by us;</hi> the hand is Chri≈øts, Mini≈øters are but the Pen. Hence it was, that the Mini≈øtry of the Scribes and Phari≈øees was not to be rejected, but to be
<pb facs="tcp:62760:190"/>e≈øteemed; ≈øo long as they ≈øailed not in the ≈øub≈øtance thereof, and hence the Apo≈øtle rejoyceth that Chri≈øt was preached of the fal≈øe Apo≈øtles, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.15, 16, 17, 18. though out of envy; take heed therefore and beware of a total ≈øeparation from di≈ø≈øerting of, and for≈øaking Church-a≈ø≈øemblies; and yet I conceive it is a very rare thing for unconverted Mini≈øters to convert ≈øome. For what ≈øaith the Lord by the Prophet <hi>Zephaniah,</hi> Zeph. 3.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Ob ≈øaith the Lord to Jeru≈øalem, that hath ≈øuch Prophets and ≈øuch Prie≈øts, woe to ≈øuch a City, to ≈øuch a Country, to ≈øuch a Pari≈øh.</hi> And what ≈øaith Chri≈øt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf in <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.14. <hi>Let them alone;</hi> oft-times it falls out ≈øo, that it made Archbi≈øhop <hi>Abbot</hi> ≈øpeak in a Lecture of his, and profe≈øs, that <hi>his heart did even bleed within him, to think of the precious Souls of many people, who had ≈øuch Mini≈øters, that if they had not been in the Mini≈øtry, they would not have been fit Hogherds for Swine.</hi> And yet we mu≈øt remember not to tye the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the Word and Sacraments, to the goodne≈øs or badne≈øs of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters per≈øon.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Take heed and beware of being leavened with prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt all Mini≈øters, becau≈øe of the Vilene≈øs, and mon≈øter-like unbe≈øeeming Carriage of ≈øome Mini≈øters. It hath been granted over and over that ≈øome Mini≈øters evil, licentious Carriage and Conver≈øations, are notorious; the Lord knows, too many Mini≈øters have <hi>E≈øau</hi>'s hands with <hi>Jacob</hi>'s voyce; what then, mu≈øt this redound to the general di≈øgrace of all Mini≈øters? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe ≈øome Profe≈ø≈øors of the Law live lawle≈øs, mu≈øt therefore all be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øured and cuodemned for the lawle≈øs Livers? becau≈øe <hi>Judas</hi> was a Devil, and a Son of Perdition, will you therefore ≈øay that all the Di≈øciples of Chri≈øt were naught? Perhaps you do know ≈øome Sir <hi>Johns,</hi> ≈øome blind Seers, ≈øome blind Watchmen, who know nor Heavens way, ≈øome blind Droans; or ≈øecondly, ≈øome that carry them≈øelves in≈øolently, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.1, 2. <hi>Pa≈øher</hi> did: or thirdly, ≈øome that are too too like that evil ≈øervant in the Go≈øpel, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.45. or perhaps you know: Fourthly, Some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtarizing <hi>Demas</hi>'s, who embrace this pre≈øent world and revolt from their principles and profe≈ø≈øion, as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. Or perhaps you know, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, ≈øome a≈øpiring and climbing <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> as 3 <hi>John</hi> 9. perhaps you know ≈øome ≈øuch as the≈øe I have in≈øtanced, what then? is there any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øion as it were, but it ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> then in the face of ≈øome, who thorow grace are free from the≈øe mi≈øcarriages, take heed and beware of being leavened with prejudice again≈øt all Mini≈øters, becau≈øe of the vilene≈øs and mi≈øcarriage of ≈øome.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Be earne≈øt with the Lord for a godly, faithful Mini≈øtry, who≈øe labour and pains among the people the Lord u≈øeth to ble≈øs; The Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt is the greate≈øt Patron of all Livings, as a reverend man
<pb facs="tcp:62760:190"/>now in Heaven, once ≈øaid; He can pre≈øent whom he will to a pari≈øh, and he can re≈øtore whom he will to their people, as <hi>Acts</hi> 12.5, 6, 7. as he did <hi>Peter</hi> out of Pri≈øon by the <hi>peoples prayers;</hi> and thus when <hi>Paul</hi> was in <hi>pri≈øon</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> ob≈øerve how he <hi>writes</hi> to <hi>Philemon,</hi> in <hi>v.</hi> 22. of his <hi>Epi≈øtle,</hi> and thus when the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> was re≈øtrained from <hi>preaching,</hi> ob≈øerve what an <hi>Exhortation</hi> he u≈øeth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.12.18. Oh pray therefore! pray for godly faithful <hi>Mini≈øters;</hi> their pains, their labours, the Lord u≈øeth to ble≈øs among a people, as <hi>Mal.</hi> 26. we read that the Lord ble≈ø≈øed the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of <hi>Levi,</hi> ≈øo that he was an in≈øtrument in the Lords hands to turn wicked men from their iniquities; and <hi>v.</hi> 5. ≈øo it was ≈øaid of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> that by his Mini≈øtry, <hi>much people were added to the Lord,</hi> Acts 11.24. And if we would have godly faithful <hi>Mini≈øters;</hi> as we mu≈øt pray for them, ≈øo we mu≈øt fir≈øt repent us of our ≈øins, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.14, 15. repent we mu≈øt for our ≈øins, and particularly our contempt of the Ordinances and wor≈øhip of God. Secondly, We mu≈øt prize the Go≈øpel more than we have done; the Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel loves to come and ≈øtay where it is welcome. Of all the 7 Churches of <hi>A≈øia,</hi> the Church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> was the be≈øt, that Church u≈øed the word be≈øt, and that Church enjoyed the word longe≈øt. Be earne≈øt with the Lord for godly faithful <hi>Mini≈øters,</hi> who≈øe pains and labours among the people the Lord u≈øeth to ble≈øs and pro≈øper.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Be earne≈øt with the Lord, that the refining work of a National-Reformation, a City, a Country, a Family-Reformation, a Per≈øonal-Reformation, may begin at the refining and purging of Mini≈øters. None will deny, but that there is a great need of a Reformation; there is none of you but will confe≈øs, that the Seed of Leaven had need ≈øometimes to be winnowed out from among≈øt us, as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.48. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> began at the <hi>Prie≈øts</hi> and <hi>Levites, Hezekiah</hi> began his reformation at them; and thus at our fir≈øt reformation, the Prote≈øtants, did then affirm, that there could never be any good reformation, unle≈øs they begun at the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> and it is very ob≈øervable, that when the <hi>Prophet</hi> ≈øpeaks of the <hi>Lord Chri≈øts</hi> coming as a refining fire, and as Fullars ≈øoap; this al≈øo is prophe≈øied of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining the Sons of <hi>Levi, Mal.</hi> 2.2. when he ≈øhall purifie the Sons of <hi>Levi,</hi> when he ≈øhall purge them as Gold and Silver; as it was in <hi>Judah,</hi> in the reign of that good King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.34. The Prie≈øts were too few there; and as it was in <hi>Judah</hi> then, whether it be not ≈øo in <hi>England</hi> now I affirm not, but leave you to judge. But a Mini≈øters <hi>≈øoundne≈øs in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> and <hi>holine≈øs of Life and Conver≈øation,</hi> ≈øhould lay a great obligation on a people, duly &amp; con≈øcienciou≈øly to practice every command to duty. And this may ≈øuffice for the ≈øecond <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Come we now to the third <hi>Doctrine,</hi> deducable to be handled from this Text, and that is, <hi>That in the due practi≈øe of commanded duties, Gods People may may warrantably and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb facs="tcp:62760:191"/>expect much of the gracious pre≈øence of the God of peace, even in the wor≈øt of times. The≈øe things think on,</hi> ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, v. 8. <hi>The≈øe things do,</hi> ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle in the Text, and what then? <hi>The God of Peace ≈øhall be with you.</hi> In the due practice of commanded duries, Gods people may confidently expect much of the gracious pre≈øence of the God of peace in the wor≈øt of times; then take coun≈øel from this Doctrine, that you may have the gracious pre≈øence of the God of peace with you; and if this Pulpit were my death-bed, I ≈øhould give ≈øuch coun≈øel as this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Crown the Prince of Peace, the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt in your hearts and lives; I ≈øay, Crown the Prince of Peace, the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, in your hearts and lives; receive him as your Lord and King, ≈øet a Crown on his head here in your hearts and lives, and he will crown you with peace in this life, and ≈øet a crown of Glory, a crown of Immortality on your heads in the life to come. If you have Chri≈øt, you have all things, all heavenly graces, and ≈øpiritual comforts, all temporal ble≈ø≈øings; if you have Chri≈øt, God will and can give you all things that are good for you; without Chri≈øt you are not, and you can do nothing that is acceptable to God. Therefore this is my fir≈øt coun≈øel to you, <hi>Crown the Prince of Peace, the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt in your hearrs and lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Then maintain a con≈øtant, and a <hi>con≈øcientious</hi> intimate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the God of peace. It was <hi>good</hi> coun≈øel which <hi>Eliphas</hi> gave to <hi>Job, Job</hi> 22.21. Would you have much of the pre≈øeuce of the God of peace? Oh! then frequently fall down and lie at the foot-≈øtool of the Lords Throne, for grace and for peace; and when you do ≈øo, be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of us, who have been often your mouths to God, and Gods mouth to you. And to engage and encourage you herein, con≈øider.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, The Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt hath promi≈øed to be with his poor Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters always, even to the end of the world. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>ult.</hi> If always, not in the Pulpit only; no, the Lord hath promi≈øed to be with his faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, out of the Pulpit, as well as in the Pulpit; in the pri≈øon ≈øealing the truth, as well in the Pulpit preaching the truth? Oh then will you put this in ≈øuit by prayer, that the Lord Chri≈øt will be with his poor Mini≈øters to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, We ≈øhall not fail to pray for you,</hi> 1. Sam. 12.23. Our ≈øeque≈øtring from our preaching-work from you, will give us advantage to lay our more time to fetch ≈øighs from our hearts in <hi>praying-work</hi> for you; and I tru≈øt the Lord will give us hearts, ≈øo to <hi>improve</hi> our time for you, as <hi>Samuel</hi> ≈øaid, ≈øo <hi>God forbid we ≈øhould ≈øin again≈øt the Lord in c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>≈øing to pray for you,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> did to the people with a promi≈øe, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. And not only for you. But</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:191"/>Secondly, Even for ≈øuch as have treated us ≈øomewhat uncivilly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly, to ≈øay no more of them, although their number be very incon≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable; but ≈øuch I tru≈øt we ≈øhall not forget in our prayers: As <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> fell down on his face for the children of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> when they treated him very unkindly, and ≈øpit in his face; I tru≈øt we ≈øhall not forget <hi>Mo≈øes</hi>'s prayer for the people: and ≈øo when they daueed before their Idol, <hi>Jeremiab</hi> wept for tho≈øe in his time, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.17. And that we ≈øhall not for get <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> weeping for you: And I tru≈øt likewi≈øe, that we ≈øhall remember <hi>Stephen</hi> being on his knees for his Per≈øecutors, powring out his life and prayer together, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.60. I doubt not but my reverend Brother, and my ≈øelf ≈øhall remember <hi>Pauls</hi> willingne≈øs to <hi>≈øpend, and to be ≈øpent both in prayer and preaching for you all.</hi> Though the more abundantly he loved, the le≈øs he was beloved, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.15.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Maintain and nouri≈øh all tenderne≈øs in your Con≈øcience all your dayes: Oh! go not without, much le≈øs again≈øt the dictates of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience, rebel not again≈øt the light of it; beware of ≈øtifling and ≈øuppre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing a warning Con≈øcience, le≈øt a warning Con≈øcience prove a gnawing Con≈øcience, and prove a tormenting Con≈øcience. And con≈øider. Fir≈øt, Remor≈øe of Con≈øcience, hath an eye again≈øt all ≈øin pa≈øt. Secondly, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne≈øs of Con≈øcience, which hath an eye to all fin to come. Take heed then of all calmne≈øs of heart.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Take heed of Apo≈øtatizing. <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtome</hi> hath a notable ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, namely, <hi>That Mini≈øters have a greater trouble, becau≈øe they never find their work as they leave it, as other workmen do.</hi> Oh! in how ≈øhort a time doth a poor Mini≈øter find all his work put out of frame and order? Did not <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> find it ≈øo? <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.8. <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> had no ≈øooner turned his back as as it were, but the People were turned out of Gods way, of wor≈øhip: And did not <hi>Paul</hi> find it ≈øo? <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6. The <hi>Galathians</hi> were quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, <hi>Paul</hi> was but lately gone from them, and they were quickly apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtatized. Now this cometh to pa≈øs;</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, It is by rea≈øon of a crafty, ≈øubtil, deceitful Devil, as in the Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel we read, <hi>While men ≈ølept, the enemy came and ≈øowed tares, Mat.</hi> 13.25. And who this Enemy is, we may ≈øee in Chri≈øts expounding the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ver. 39.</p>
            <p>And ≈øecondly, Partly by rea≈øon of mens own deceitful hearts, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 3 12. ob≈øerve it. There is an evil heart of unbelief in the be≈øt, it dwells in the be≈øt, but it raigns in the wicked; And what is that? one of the≈øe evil hearts of unbelief, in apo≈øtatizing, in departing from the living God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is partly by rea≈øon of deceitful Workers, as the Apo≈øtle calls fal≈øe Apo≈øtles. It is partly by rea≈øon of ≈øuch: Then take heed of
<pb facs="tcp:62760:192"/>Apo≈øtatizing, either from truth of Doctrine, purity of Wor≈øhip, or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Conver≈øation.</p>
            <p>

            <p>

            <p>It is that inward, ≈øpiritual ≈øatisfaction that the heart of a gracious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon finds in, and through Je≈øus Chri≈øt, in all the various di≈øpen≈øation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of God towards him, whereby he is enabled to go on in chearfulne≈øs in the way that God would have him, whether it be by a way of doing, or of ≈øuffering. And herein I ≈øhewed,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The nature of the ≈øpiritual ≈øatisfaction.</item>
               <item>2. The Author of it; It is God by his Spirit.</item>
               <item>3. The Object of it; God through Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</item>
               <item>4. The proper ≈øubject of this inward ≈øpiritual comfort; the people of God.</item>
               <item>5. And la≈øtly, The effects of the ≈øpiritual comfort; it is to ≈øtrengthen the heart both to do, and to ≈øuffer.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I came the la≈øt time to ≈øhew you how the Spirit of God doth this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He doth it as an enlightning Spirit, By ≈øhewing where comfort is to be had, by opening the eyes of the under≈øtanding, as he did <hi>Hagars</hi> bodily eyes to ≈øee the Well of Water.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He doth it as a quickning Spirit, bringing the Soul into that capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to take in the comfort; for what comfort can a dead man receiver? a Cordial and Puddle is all one to a dead man.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He works this inward ≈øpiritual ≈øatisfaction, by di≈øcovering the truth of his vital Principle in the Soul: for a man may have a principle of <hi>grace</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:193"/>and ≈øpiritual life in him, and not know it; that though he has the ≈øpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual comfort, yet it is all one as if he had it not.</p>
            <p>Now this is the great Que≈øtion that is debated in the heart of a childe of God, <hi>Whether he be regenerated and born again? Whether he hath grace in his ≈øoul, that grace that will qualifie him for glory?</hi> and if he was ≈øatisfied as to this, he would not be a moment without comfort: But he is afraid that he is dead in ≈øin, that he is a ≈øtranger to the life of grace: hence ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth all the Spiritual troubles: Now the Spirit of God comes in, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolves the ca≈øe, comes into the ≈øoul by his bright reflections, and fills our ≈øouls with comfort: Now we have received not the ≈øpirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Spirit of God is a comforting Spirit, as he openeth the vein of godly ≈øorrow in the ≈øoul: Truly this is the next way to ≈øpiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, when a man can once ≈øpiritually mourn for ≈øin, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed are they that mourn, for they ≈øhall be comforted.</hi> Godly ≈øorrow opens the vein, and lets out the matter that hinders comfort, and cau≈øeth inward trouble in the ≈øoul: A gracious man takes a great delight in godly ≈øorrow: Oh! it's matter of marvellous comfort to a Child of God, when he can kindly mourn for his ≈øins.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Spirit of God comforts the ≈øoul as he is a mortyfying Spirit. Thus he takes away that that is the ground and matter of Believers trouble, mortifying that ≈øin that is the cau≈øe of his ≈øorrows, pride, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, inordinate love to the World.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Spirit of God works comfort in the hearts of his people by ≈øetting their own ≈øpirit to ≈øeek for comfort in Gods own wayes.</p>
            <p>The la≈øt thing that I did for the explication of the Doctrine, was to add ≈øome Propo≈øitions, and they are ≈øuch as the≈øe:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Many a gracious heart that hath fellow≈øhip with the ≈øpirit of God in his ≈øanctifying work, may feel and find none in his comforting work.</hi> The Sun may operate where it doth not ≈øhine: A man may be in a ≈øtate of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, when it doth not feel the joyes of Salvation, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 51.3. You ≈øhall find tho≈øe that fear the Lord, and had the comforts of the Holy Gho≈øt, yet walked in darkne≈øs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Even tho≈øe gracious ≈øouls that have the fellow≈øhip of the comforting ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to day, may want it to morrow:</hi> This is not daily bread, while the Saints are on this ≈øide Heaven. The Sol≈øtice of a Chri≈øtians comfort doth not la≈øt all the day long, they are not fea≈øted with this every day; they have the night as well as the day, there is a night as well as a day in the heart of a gracious ≈øoul: as it is natural in the common cour≈øe of nature, the Sun may ≈øhine to day, but it may be clouded to morrow. Thus it was
<pb facs="tcp:62760:193"/>with that holy man, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 30.7. <hi>Lord, by thy favour thou ha≈øt made my moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to ≈øtand ≈øtrong; thou did≈øt hide thy face and I was troubled.</hi> And God doth this in infinite wi≈ødom, to put a difference between Earth and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; this valley of tears, and that ≈øtate of Glory; that ≈øo the hearts of Gods people may be kept in frame of longing after the ≈øtate of Heaven; God will have his people be groaning here, that his people may groan after that condition when all ≈øorrowing and ≈øighing ≈øhall flee away. God re≈øerves perfect comfort to be the reward of perfect holine≈øs; while our graces are imperfect, we mu≈øt make account that our comfort will be ≈øo too; Tears will be never wiped from our eyes, till ≈øin be quite taken out of our hearts.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Tho≈øe that have had this ≈øpiritual comfort in their Souls, they may lo≈øe not only the impre≈ø≈øion of the Spirits comfort, but they may feel the impre≈ø≈øion of Gods anger. Haman</hi> complains, <hi>That the wrath of God did bang upon him, and that the terrors of God had out him off.</hi> A gracious heart hath real grounds of Con≈øolation, though he hath not pre≈øent ≈øen≈øible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</p>
            <p>A child of God hath always that, that if he did ≈øee, he could not be without comfort; the Promi≈øes are his ≈øupport, he hath the fir≈øt fruits of the Spirit, and right to eternal life: A Child of God ≈øhall always have ≈øo much to keep up his hopes and affiance upon God; A Child of God, in the darke≈øt condition, though he doth not ≈øee enough to make him rejoyce in God, yet he ≈øees enough to make him tru≈øt in God: though he walk in darkne≈øs, and ≈øee no light, yet he tru≈øts in God. <hi>Job</hi> ≈øayes, <hi>Though the Lord ≈ølay him, yet be would tru≈øt in him. David</hi> was in great trouble, while he was in that di≈øquiet expo≈øtulation, <hi>Why art thou ca≈øt down, O my Soul! and why art thou di≈øquieted within me! tru≈øt in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Tho≈øe that have inward comforts from the Spirit, may at the ≈øame time have little comfort from Gods outward di≈øpen≈øations.</hi> It may be dark without, when it is light within; while <hi>Stephen</hi> ≈øees nothing but blood here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, he ≈øaw Heaven above: And Chri≈øt rells his Di≈øciples, <hi>In the world they ≈øhall have tribulation, but in him they ≈øhall have peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. And la≈øtly, <hi>Though this be one great work of the Spirit of God, to comfort the hearts of Chri≈øts Di≈øciples, yet there are ≈øome ≈øpecial ≈øea≈øons wherein the Spirit of God gives out this comfort.</hi> There are ≈øea≈øons of ≈øadne≈øs, there is a ≈øea≈øon of heavine≈øs, and there is need of it: <hi>There is a time to weep, and a time to laugh, a time to mourn, and a time to dance.</hi> I ≈øhewed you ≈øome of the Sea≈øons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. One ≈øpecial ≈øea≈øon of the Spirits comforting the renewing Soul,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:194"/>is pre≈øently upon the Souls fir≈øt ≈øalvation. After the ≈øpirit is become a Spirit of Adoption, pre≈øently it becomes a Spirit of Con≈øolation; after the Spirit hath come into the ≈øoul in the Law, it then nextly appears a Spirit in the Go≈øpel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another ≈øea≈øon when the Spirit gives out this comfort, is ju≈øt before the Lord layes upon his people any great affliction. When was it that <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> was transfigured, and his face did ≈øhine as the Sun? it was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before his bloody pa≈ø≈øion. <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> was fir≈øt taken into the Mount, before he was lifted up upon the Cro≈øs. When was the voice heard, <hi>This is my Beloved Son in whom I am well plea≈øed?</hi> but ju≈øt before he was led into the Wilderne≈øs, to be tempted When was <hi>Paul</hi> lifted up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? it was immediately before Satan was ≈øent to buffet him. Thus God gives his people ≈øomething beforehand to ≈øupport their Spirits, that they may not faint; the Di≈øciples were full of comfort, <hi>Acts</hi> 5 41. And when was this? immediately ju≈øt before they were carryed before the Council, and whipt up and down like Vagabonds and Rogues, for preaching the Go≈øpel.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another Sea≈øon when the Spirit gives out this Comfort, is in the time of ≈øuffering. God comes in the nick of time, e≈øpecially if a man ≈øuffer for righteou≈øne≈øs ≈øake, if this ≈øuffering be upon the account of Chri≈øt, he ≈øeldom ≈øails to ≈øend the Comforter for the relieving of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.13. <hi>But rejoyce in as much as ye are partakers of Chri≈øts ≈øuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that when his glory ≈øhall be revealed, ye may be glad al≈øo with exceeding joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bodily confinement, and in ward ≈øtraits are the time of the ≈øouls grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øt inlargement. <hi>John</hi> had his vi≈øion in the I≈øle of <hi>Patmos.</hi> When a Child of God is brought to a piece of bread, then is the ≈øea≈øon for God to feed him with heavenly <hi>Manna; Jacob</hi> had glorious Vi≈øions, while he was flying from the wrath of his Brother, when he had nothing but a heap of Stones for his Pillow. It was in the Wilderne≈øs that God ≈øpeaks to his Church thus. I told you of Mr. <hi>Glover,</hi> a Pri≈øoner, who found no comfort in the time of his impri≈øonment; but when he was going to the ≈øtake he cryed out, <hi>He is come, be is come,</hi> meaning the Spirit, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another ≈øea≈øon of Comfort is, after ≈øome ≈øpecial exerci≈øe of grace, godly ≈øorrow-for ≈øin, free actions in the pardon of ≈øin, and new Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>s, and Re≈øolutions, and Promi≈øes of more clo≈øe walking with God, after declining from him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Another ≈øea≈øon of Comfort is, After ≈øome great Tryals and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. Light is then mo≈øt plea≈øant, when we newly are come out of a
<pb facs="tcp:62760:194"/>dark place; after Thunder comes Lightning; after a Storm comes a Calm: God led his people fir≈øt into the Wilderne≈øs, and then into the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> It is often ≈øo in Gods Di≈øpen≈øations towards his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, their greate≈øt Afflictions go before their greate≈øt Deliverances: And therefore let not the Saints of God de≈øpair when they are at the lowe≈øt, when they walk in darkne≈øs, and ≈øee no light, yet let them tru≈øt in the Lord.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Another Sea≈øon of comfort was, when men were con≈øcienciou≈øly diligent in their particular Callings, then they walk with God. To this I gave you an in≈øtance in the Shepherds, they were faithful and diligent in their Callings, they were watching over their flocks by night, and then the Angel comes and tells them, <hi>To you is born this day in the City of David a Saviour, which is Chri≈øt the Lord,</hi> Luke 2.11. A company of poor Shepherds, keeping of their Sheep, God appears unto them, and manife≈øteth his comforting Pre≈øence, when the Scribes and Pha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>i≈øees, notwith≈øtanding all their long prayers, and their ≈øtrict Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, hear not a word of him.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Another Sea≈øon of comfort is, when we are either preparing for, or in the ≈øpiritual act of ≈øome duty. When grace is exerci≈øed to prepare the heart to pray, and in attendance upon ≈øuch an Ordinance, then oftentimes the Spirit of God is with them, to let poor ≈øouls in their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors finde acceptance with God. <hi>Hannah</hi> had been praying to God; But what melody did ≈øhe finde in her heart! When <hi>Mary</hi> ≈øate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>at: Chri≈øts feet, how doth Chri≈øt fill her heart with comfort, ≈øealing up her ≈øalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to her! I now come to clo≈øe with ≈øome Application.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øe of Information.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>U≈øe. <hi>If it be the work of the Spirit of God to comfort the hearts of Chri≈øts Di≈øciples,</hi> then by way of Information I gather this, <hi>That a poor ≈øoul is very hardly ≈øetled and ≈øatisfied in point of Comfort.</hi> Sure it is a hard matter to comfort a poor ≈øoul, when one of the Per≈øons of the ble≈ø≈øed Trinity mu≈øt be employed on purpo≈øe to do it. This is an office belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Holy Gho≈øt, when he is to be the <hi>Paraclec,</hi> the comfort of the Holy Gho≈øt. This ≈øure is a hard matter to comfort the wounded ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, when the ≈øoul is full of the ≈øpirit of bondage. Oh! the he≈øitates, the jealou≈øies, the doubts and fears, the objections that a poor ≈øoul makes again≈øt his ≈øpiritual peace and comfort! now it begins to take comfort, then it doubts again; now he believeth, and takes courage, but anon he is afraid; there is a great deal ado to fa≈øten comfort upon a poor ≈øoul,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:195"/>2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22, 23. What a heap of Words are there together, and it is all lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle enough to comfort a poor ≈øoul! <hi>Now he that e≈øtabli≈øheth us with you in Chri≈øt, and hath anointed us, is God, and hath al≈øo ≈øealed us, and given the earne≈øt of the ≈øpirit in our hearts.</hi> It is not without much tugging and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the ≈øoul is fir≈øt brought to believe, and then, when it doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, it is a hard thing to per≈øwade it that it doth believe: There is a ≈øtrange kind of ≈øquemi≈øhne≈øs upon the heart, he thinks that there is no comfort to be taken that doth belong to him. <hi>Luther</hi> ≈øays, <hi>It is a harder thing to comfort a troubled Con≈øcience, than to rai≈øe the dead.</hi> Surely it mu≈øt be as hard, when nothing but the ≈øame power mu≈øt do it.</p>
            <p>The ≈øoul is hardly convinced; but all the glad tidings of the Go≈øpel, are golden ≈øtreams, and all the Promi≈øes are but plea≈øant Fancies, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Reality; but that the≈øe things ≈øhould belong to him, this he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe, for want of faith: So that the Spirit of God is fain to come in, and end the controver≈øie, before the ≈øoul will be ≈øatisfied.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If it be the work of the Spirit of God to comfort the hearts of his people: Then all the comfort of Chri≈øtle≈øs and gracele≈øs ≈øouls is nothing worth, there is no true peace, for they are not the Di≈øciples of Chri≈øt, which are the proper ≈øubjects of this comfort; they will not hearken to Chri≈øt; nor learn of Chri≈øt, but they <hi>ca≈øt his words behind their backs, and break his bands a≈øunder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho≈øe that do not learn Chri≈øts Precepts, and follow Chri≈øts Canons, and obey Chri≈øts Commands, they are none of Chri≈øts Di≈øciples; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>d to be ≈øure, they have not the Spirit of Chri≈øt, which is the Efficient in this comfort; and without the root, there cannot be the fruit; for this inward peace is the fruit of the Spirit. And therefore what comfort they have, it is either a ≈øinful comfort, which to be ≈øure will end in ≈øorrow, or el≈øe at be≈øt, it is but a carnal comfort, which will ≈øoon vani≈øh like the crackling of thorns under a Pot; <hi>There is no peace,</hi> ≈øaith God, <hi>to the wicked;</hi> there is no peace with God, as long as you are at peace wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>h ≈øin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Here they are ≈øtumbled with the Riddle, That the people of God ≈øhould be ≈øorrowing, yet always rejoycing; <hi>As ≈øorrowing, yet always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing:</hi> The carnal world think this to be a contradiction; though they be troubled without, yet they have peace within; though they have ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ≈øorrow in re≈øpect of outward affliction, yet they have fellow≈øhip with the Holy Gho≈øt the comforter, which gives peace in affliction, joy in ≈øorrow, light in darkne≈øs, which fills thee with joy un≈øpeakable, and full of glory.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If the Holy Gho≈øt be the only Comforter of the hearts

Though you have ≈øome comfort, it is but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in compari≈øon of what you may have, and in compari≈øon of what you may ≈øtand in need of, though a Saint would not change the ≈øadde≈øt hour of his life for the ≈øweete≈øt hour in his former condition. If the Saints of God did enjoy the comforts that they might, oh what ble≈ø≈øed lives might they live! but they are ≈øo full of trouble, as if there were no Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gho≈øt the Comforter. The people of God are oftentimes troubled without a cau≈øe, as that holy man, <hi>Why art thou ca≈øt down, oh my ≈øoul?</hi> He could not render a true account of his trouble, he was ≈øad, but he could not tell why or wherefore.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When there is cau≈øe, they are apt to be troubled without mea≈øure. In tho≈øe ca≈øes, where it is a ≈øin not to be troubled at all, the people of God are apt to be troubled over-much, as the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> in their bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage in <hi>Egypt.</hi> It were a ≈øin for them not to be troubled, but they were ≈øo full of troubles, that they could not hearken to <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> And ≈øo the Di≈øciples in the Text, it were a ≈øin for them not to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for the ab≈øence of Chri≈øts body; but ≈øo to be troubled, as if God could not comfort them without him, this was their weakne≈øs: And to come to our Ca≈øes, it were a ≈øin to ≈ølight this Di≈øpen≈øation of God that is coming upon us, if we ≈øhould not be troubled for the lo≈øs of the Mini≈øters of Je≈øus Chri≈øt: but to mourn before God under the ≈øen≈øe of this Di≈øpen≈øation, to mourn ≈øo much, as to think that when the≈øe are gone, all are gone, to be ≈øo much troubled, as not to hearken to the words of the Text, <hi>That we have a Comforter.</hi> I remember an admirable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion of a Child to his Mother, when his Father was dead, to ≈øhew, <hi>That out of the mouths of Babes and Sucklings God can manife≈øt his prai≈øe.

Is not the Spirit of God alive? Though you have ≈øome comfort, yet you have little in compari≈øon of what you may have, if you ≈øeek for it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Study the excellent nature of the comfort, how little ≈øoever a man hath of this ≈øpiritual comfort, it will ≈øweeten his condition, be it what it will be. When a Man hath communion with the ≈øpirit God, he hath comfort in all conditions: then, though a mans condition be never ≈øo

All outward cro≈ø≈øes cannot hinder the≈øe inward comforts: a man that hath the≈øe inward comforts, may have a Fea≈øt with bread and water, a little of this comfort is able to ≈øweeten a whole Ocean of ≈øorrow: <hi>In the multitude of my th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that when the hearts of God's people are filled with ≈øad thoughts, what will become of them≈øelves, what will become of their Families, what will become of the Church of God, what will become of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øtery of the Go≈øpel, and of the Ordinances of Chri≈øt? they are full of ≈øad fears, and di≈øtracting thoughts, when they have a multitude of thougts, in the mid≈øt of all, the≈øe ≈øpiritual comforts can comfort and refre≈øh the Soul: Oh labour after a greater ≈øhare of this comfort.</p>
            <p>God hath ca≈øt us upon ≈øad times, wherein we ≈øhall have need of more than ordinary comfort: We are like to have troubles without, if we have not peace within, it will be very ≈øad: we are like to lo≈øe much of Chri≈øt's bodily pre≈øence, I mean in his Ordinances: how many of tho≈øe Me≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that pre≈øent the per≈øon of Chri≈øt, and ≈øtand in his ≈øtead? If we ≈øhould not enjoy the other comforter, our e≈øtates would be doleful: If we have darkne≈øs without, and darkne≈øs within, how ≈øad will that darkne≈øs be.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Labour to get more communion from the Spirit of God. This will rai≈øe and ≈øublimate your natural comforts, and turn them into Spiritual comforts. A man can never reli≈øh the≈øe outward comforts, till he come to ta≈øte the ravi≈øhment and ≈øweetne≈øs of the holy Gho≈øt, till he ta≈øte the love of God: the≈øe give them a higher lu≈øtre than the men of the world; though they enjoy much comfort, yet they do not enjoy half that a child of God doth; the little that the righteous hath, is better than the great revenues of the wicked; to a Child of God a dinner of green hearbs is more ≈øavoury and plea≈øant to him, than the ≈øtalled Ox, becau≈øe a Child of God hath better ≈øauce with it.</p>
            <p>Worldly men they ≈ømell to their flowers, it is the only godly man that
<pb facs="tcp:62760:197"/>≈øucks out the honey; that all things are given to him in love, out of this he ≈øucks comfort: A gracious heart ≈øees all the≈øe outward comforts, that they are purcha≈øed with the bloud of Chri≈øt, and therefore the≈øe ≈øhould do him good, and he may take comfort that he hopes for what he hath not, as wel as for what he may have; and he may take comfort in his condition, be it what it will, he ≈øees all is for his good; ≈øuch a one believeth what he readeth not: So he believeth Gods ways are ways of Truth, though ≈øome more ≈øweet, and ≈øome more bitter.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Labor after communion with the Spirit in his comforing work, is another. This is the be≈øt pre≈øervative again≈øt all intanglements of ≈øin what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever: It is a great hour of temptation, and if our comforts do do not lie above the world, we ≈øhall be greatly in≈ønared by the world; If a man eat ≈øweet-meats, he cannot reli≈øh ordinary food: ≈øo while the≈øe ≈øweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts lie upon the ≈øoul, he cannot reli≈øh the≈øe ordinary things in the world: What, do you tempt me with tho≈øe things, ≈øaith a child of God? What are the≈øe to the comforts of the Holy God? The heart of man will ≈øeek comfort one way or another; and if he hath it not from the Spirit of God, he will ≈øeek it ≈øome other way; if he hath not comfort from the Spirit of God, he will ≈øeek ≈øome ≈øparks of his own kindling; rather than they will ≈øit in darkne≈øs without comfort, they will light their candle at the Devil's fire: And as he delivereth from temptation on the right, ≈øo he delivereth from temptation on the left hand: he that is filled with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the Holy Gho≈øt, what are ≈øufferings to ≈øuch a man? he hath that within will carry him through all danger, here is that comfort, and that life by Chri≈øt, which may ea≈øe us in our greate≈øt cro≈ø≈øes; this will make a child of God ≈øpeak of the ≈øufferings of this world as a light matter. Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, ≈øhall work out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory: They took joyfully the ≈øpoiling of their goods, becau≈øe in Heaven they had a better and more enduring ≈øub≈øtance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. Some were tortured, receiving no deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, becau≈øe in Heaven they had a better ≈øub≈øtance.

            <p>It would be more then the time would permit, to look over the whole Apo≈øtles Sermons, which is partly Narrative, and partly con≈øolatory: Narrative, to put them in mind in what manner he had preached to them, from ver. 17. to ver. 27. and it is partly con≈øolatory: from the 27. to the Text, wherein the Apo≈øtle could hold no longer, but his love con≈øtrains him, and makes him break forth into the pathetical wi≈øh, or rather prayer, <hi>And now, Brethren, I commend you to his Grace.</hi> As if he had ≈øaid, I am ju≈øt now going from you, not knowing that I ≈øhall ≈øee your face any more: now I am a dying man, as to my conver≈øing with you, any more: Now I am departing, this is the be≈øt Legacy I can bequeath unto you, <hi>To commend you to God and to his Grace.</hi> And if he ≈øpeaks to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons as ≈øtanding in the ≈øame relation with God and Chri≈øt, and having the ≈øame Faith, and the ≈øame elder Brother: As if he ≈øhould have ≈øaid, You are as dear to me as my own fle≈øh, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:62760:199"/>by Con≈øanguinity, and it is my ≈øorrow that I mu≈øt leave you; but as it is my greate≈øt grief to part with you, and mu≈øt leave you, yet this is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that I ≈øhall leave you in ≈øafe hands, I do not leave you to the wide world, I do not leave you as Orphans without a Father, as Sheep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Shepheard, but <hi>I commend you to God and his Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O happy words! Though I mu≈øt leave you, yet, I tru≈øt, God who is able, will keep you. As God is pre≈øent every where by his E≈ø≈øence, ≈øo by his gracious pre≈øence more e≈øpecially, God is pre≈øent with his people. I commit yon, I commend you to God, I commit you to his care, to his keeping, ≈øo the word ≈øignifies; ≈øo <hi>Pavenelus</hi> interprets the words, I tru≈øt you with God, I leave you as a <hi>Depo≈øitum</hi> in Gods hands, as a dying man leaves his Children in a Friends hands to look after them: as Chri≈øt did his Mother in <hi>Johns</hi> hands: So the Apo≈øtle leaves the <hi>Ephe≈øians</hi> in the <hi>hands of God and the Word of his Grace;</hi> that is, the Go≈øpel that he had declared to them. The Word of God in Scripture is often called his Grace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.5<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> becau≈øe it is a declaration of the free Grace of God to poor ≈øouls, and becau≈øe it is the Spirits in≈øtrument to work grace in the hearts of ≈øinners.</p>
            <p>This is remarkable, That after the Apo≈øtle had recommended them to God, he adds this word, <hi>of his grace:</hi> He doth not think it enough to mention Recommending them to God, but to the Word of his grace. The expre≈ø≈øion is not for <hi>Euphoniae gratia,</hi> it is no tautology, it is not for more than needs, but to ≈øhew how needful and nece≈ø≈øary the word of Gods grace is, as well to the building up, as for the converting poor ≈øinners: and though God can build up a Saint immediately, yet ordinarily he doth it not but by the Word of his Grace, which is able to build you. <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> refer this clau≈øe to God, an≈øwering to that of the Apo≈øtle 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.18. <hi>God is able to cau≈øe all grace to abound in you.</hi> But <hi>Era≈ømus</hi> refers this word to the Word of <hi>Gods Grace which is able to build you up.</hi> And this Con≈øtruction is favoured by tho≈øe two places of Scripture, and may very well be meant both in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.21. both which places attribute to the Word of God, as this doth: And in the ≈øecond place, <hi>Receive with meckne≈øs the ingrafted Word, which is able to ≈øave your ≈øouls.</hi> So that both the≈øe words may be referred to this cau≈øe; The word of God, and the Word of his Grace; to God, as the Principle; and to the Word of his Grace, as the In≈øtrumental cau≈øe to build them up: As much as if he had ≈øaid, I commend you to the Grace of God, which is able to build you up. The Apo≈øtle tells them, that he left them to ≈øuch a God, as through the Go≈øpel was ≈øufficient to build them up, till he brought them to the full fruition of the Saints in light.
<pb facs="tcp:62760:200"/>The Apo≈øtle commends this to his Church, that were ready to weep, and fay at his departure, O <hi>Paul!</hi> God hath made thee a happy In≈øtrument of laying a good Foundation among us, of doing a great deal of good to our ≈øouls, and we may ble≈øs God that ever we ≈øaw thy face; but now, alas! thou art going from us, we are afraid all thy pains will come to nothing; we ≈øhould hope, that if God had plea≈øed to continue thee among us, then we ≈øhould have been built up; and ≈øurely, if God had intended good to us, and brought us to Heaven at la≈øt, he would not have taken thee from us. No, ≈øayes the Apo≈øtle, be not di≈øcouraged; though I leave you, yet <hi>I commit you to God, and to the word of his Grace.</hi> If I be here, it is God alone that mu≈øt build you up; I am but a poor, weak In≈øtrument in the hand of God: And when I am gone, God can build you up by ≈øome means or other, and earry you over, or thorow all oppo≈øitions, temptations and di≈øcouragements, till he bath fitted you for him≈øelf, and given you an inheritance among≈øt them that are ≈øanctified.</p>
            <p>Thus have you the words explained in this familiar Paraphra≈øe; and being thus opened, you may take notice that</p>
            <p>The words hold forth the ≈øpecial care of this ble≈ø≈øed Apo≈øtle of Je≈øus Chri≈øt; Though he mu≈øt leave them, yet he takes care to leave them in ≈øafe hands, that was able to give a good account of them; You have the Apo≈øtle making a deed of tru≈øt for the ≈øecurement of the Saints at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus</hi> after his departure; or, if you will, you have the Apo≈øtles la≈øt Will and Te≈øtament.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Thus doth our holy Apo≈øtle: When he was taken from his people, and left to preach to them no more, he recommends them to the hands of God. And thus doth a greater than St. <hi>Paul,</hi> even Je≈øus Chri≈øt him≈øelf, <hi>The great Shepherd of the Sheep,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls him; when he was lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the world, and could no longer preach to them, he commends them to God, <hi>John</hi> 17.11. And now, ≈øays Chri≈øt to his Father, <hi>I am no more in the world, but the≈øe are in the world, and I come to thee.

               </gap>ly it.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, It is to leave them in the hand of God, to give them up unto Gods care and keeping, as I ≈øhewed you in the opening of the words: To recommend them to God, is, to do that for them effectually which he would fain do Mini≈øterially, if he had been ≈øuffered to continue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. As when a dying Father or Husband commends his wife
<pb facs="tcp:62760:201"/>and children to ≈øome ≈øurviving intimate friend, it is a leaving, a commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to that friend, to deal, and to do for them, which he would have done, if he had lived.</p>
            <p>Now let us con≈øider what it is that a faithful Mini≈øters de≈øign and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours are to do for that Congregation that is committed to his charge. The≈øe four things e≈øpecially every faithful Mini≈øter endeavours to do while he is among≈øt his people.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Their Conver≈øion and Sanctification.</item>
               <item>2. Their Building and Edification.</item>
               <item>3. Their Protection and Pre≈øervation.</item>
               <item>4. Their Comfort and Con≈øolation.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Their Conver≈øion and turning to God. This is that a faithful Mini≈øters heart is ≈øet upon, that he may convert poor ≈øouls that are in a ≈øinful ≈øtate; that he may turn poor ≈øouls to God; that by often preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and praying, and coun≈øel, he may bring them into a ≈øtate of ≈øalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.1. The Apo≈øtle there ≈øpeaks of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they were the people of God in profe≈ø≈øion: ah, but this was not enough, fain he would that they ≈øhould be the people of God-in truth; that is the hearty de≈øire of every faithful Mini≈øter, not only to bring his people to the outward profe≈ø≈øion of godline≈øs, but to the work and power of it in their hearts; not only to have the name of Chri≈øtian, but Chri≈øtianity it ≈øelf; and this is the end of all his ≈øtudying, to get them to God by little and little, till Chri≈øt be formed in them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.11. <hi>My little Children,</hi> ≈øays the Apo≈øtle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> travels in birth with the <hi>Galathians</hi> from a ≈øtate of nature, to a ≈øtate of grace, he would get grace wrought in their hearts, he would get them ingraffed into Chri≈øt; and this is the end of his commending them to God, which he would fain have done, if he might have been ≈øuffered to preach to them. This is the language of a Mini≈øters heart; Lord, Lord, thou knowe≈øt that it was the de≈øire of my ≈øoul, that every one of this people ≈øhould be made holy by thy Word; I would fain have begotten them by the Mini≈øtry to Je≈øus Chri≈øt; but now by the providence of God I am taken off before my work is done, and thou ≈øee≈øt yet there is a great many in the gaul of bitterne≈øs, and the bond of iniquity, in a ≈øtate of death, and I am now likely not to do any thing more: Now it is my care, that tho≈øe that belong to thy Election of grace, may be gathered home to thee.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To build them up in knowledge and faith. He endeavours that tho≈øe that are already ≈øanctified, may be further built up in their mo≈øt holy faith; Where there are the mo≈øt eminent Saints, yet there is a great
<pb facs="tcp:62760:201"/>deal lacking. The Apo≈øtle gives great commendation of the <hi>The≈ø≈øalon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> 1 <hi>The≈ø≈ø.</hi> 3.10. They were a famous Church, and there were a great many eminent Chri≈øtians, yet there was ≈øomething lacking in their faith, and in their knowledge. Chri≈øt ≈øpeaks to one of the mo≈øt eminent Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles, <hi>Oh thou of little faith!</hi> Though the Foundation-≈øtone be laid, yet there is a ≈øuper≈øtructure behind, and this is the work of Chri≈øt, the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.12. This is the end of every faithful Mini≈øter, to make his people fit for Heaven; he would be feeding of them, that they may grow to the full mea≈øure of the ≈øtature of Chri≈øt: And therefore every godly Mini≈øter de≈øires that he may be the Fini≈øher, as well as the Author (under God) of their Faith, that they may be built up to Chri≈øts heavenly Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A Mini≈øter's aims are, that his people may be kept from danger. The people of God, after they are effectually called, they are continually in danger, they are as a Lilly among≈øt Thorns, as Sheep among Wolves, as a be≈øieged City in the mid≈øt of her enemies.</p>
            <p>They have enemies without, and enemies within: enemies without, the Devil is their adver≈øary.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are in danger, in re≈øpect of the Devil, who is a very potent enemy, a roaring Lyon, and a malicious enemy, malicious again≈øt God: and indu≈øtrious enemy, <hi>He goes about ≈øeeking whom he may devour;</hi> he compa≈ø≈øeth the earth, to do what he can to keep ≈øouls from Chri≈øt; he is a ≈øubtil enemy, that hath his ≈øtratagems to catch and en≈øhare poor ≈øouls. Now it is the endeavour of every true Mini≈øter of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, to ≈øecure his people by his coun≈øel, and his prayers; for we are ignorant of his devices, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. As if he ≈øhould ≈øay, I have mo≈øt experience of the Devils ≈øubtilty, Satan ≈øets to oppo≈øe them mo≈øt; and this is one thing, to rob Mini≈øters of their meditations, of their prayers; and therefore it is the de≈øign of Mini≈øters to ≈øtrengthen their people, in regard of Satans temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are in danger in re≈øpect of ≈øeducers, that lie in wait to deceive.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They are in danger by the World, le≈øt they ≈øhould be frighted by its oppo≈øition.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They are in danger by their corrupt lu≈øts, that war again≈øt their ≈øouls: Therefore every faithful Mini≈øter warns his people of tho≈øe, that their ≈øouls may be ≈øecured; this being that that a faithful Mini≈øter would do among his people while he is with them; when he is taken from them, he commits them to God to be ≈øocured from all danger, as Chri≈øt in that place before, <hi>Father, keep them in thine own hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:202"/>La≈øtly, Every faithful Mini≈øter ≈øeeks the comfort and con≈øolation of his people. It is their de≈øire to comfort the feeble hands; they are not Ma≈øters of your grace, but helpers of your joy, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.12. Where the Go≈øpel appears in power, many will ≈øtand in need of comfort, under doubts, fears, and afflictions; and this is the de≈øire of every faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øter of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, at their departure from their people, to ≈øupport the weak, to re≈øolve the doubted, to ≈øuccour the tempted; and when he is taken from them, and can contribute little to this work, he recommends them to God.

            <p n="2">2. God is able to build up tho≈øe that are converted, God is able to make all grace abound, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.8. Tho≈øe that have little grace, God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make it increa≈øe; God is the God of all grace, God can make eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Saint perfect, entire, lacking nothing; he can ≈øill all the void places of the heart.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God can keep us in all tryals and troubles; God can keep up his people in the mid≈øt of Apo≈øtacy, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.13. <hi>The gates of Hell ≈øhall not prevail again≈øt them.</hi> God can keep them, that all the power of Hell ≈øhall not hurt them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. God is able to comfort the mo≈øt di≈øcon≈øolate ≈øoul. Mini≈øters may ≈øpeak comfortable words, but they cannot ≈øpeak them further than to the ear; but God can ≈øpeak them to the heart: <hi>I will allure her into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and ≈øpeak to the heart.</hi> God can comfort the poor ≈øoul, let the ca≈øe be never ≈øo ≈øad, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As God is infinitely able, ≈øo he is infinitely gracious, and faithful. See his Name in <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. <hi>Full of power and tender mercy.</hi> Is not God willing for the Conver≈øation of poor ≈øinners, as willing as Mini≈øters? yea a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand, and ten thou≈øand times more. Hear how patiently God ≈øpeaks, <hi>Turn ye, why will you dye? Hear and live.</hi> He calls upon men every where to repent.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God doth not only de≈øire it, but purpo≈øe it, and re≈øolve it. God that hath begun a good work, he will fini≈øh it; and ≈øo for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervation, he hath ≈øaid, <hi>That the gates of Hell ≈øhall never prevail again≈øt them. Of all thou ha≈øt given me, I have lo≈øt none,</hi> John 17.11. Though God may ≈øuffer his people to be led away for a time, yet they ≈øhall be brought back again, and ≈øhall be kept through the power of God unto ≈øalvation: <hi>Heaven and Earth ≈øhall pa≈øs away, but not one jot or tittle which God hath ≈øpoken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How willing is God to comfort all his comfortle≈øs ones? What Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can be more pitiful to her ≈øick child, than God is to them that are under affliction: <hi>Though a Mother forget her ≈øucking child, yet God cannot
<pb facs="tcp:62760:203"/>forget his people.</hi> And then he is the Father of all <hi>comfort,</hi> and there are many gracious promi≈øes God hath made to this purpo≈øe, that they may be as ≈øo many <hi>Aquavitae</hi> pledges of Con≈øolation to his people: So that this will appear, That it is the be≈øt Office of a Mini≈øter, both to Mini≈øter and People, <hi>to commend them to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To Mini≈øters, it is the highe≈øt expre≈ø≈øion of their love: What greater te≈øtimony of their love can they ≈øhew to their people, to do all that for them, that he would willingly have done, and ten thou≈øand times more? Is it not an expre≈ø≈øion of love from a dying Father to his children, Dear Children, I am now dying, I can provide for you no more, I ≈øhall leave you ≈øuch a Friend that ≈øhall provide for you in a more abundant mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure than if I had been with you: It is the be≈øt demon≈øtration of their Faith.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he will not leave them to the wide world: and then</p>
            <p n="2">2. He will not take any one, he will tru≈øt his people with none but God, who is able and willing to give account of them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is the greate≈øt ≈øatisfaction to his heart. A Mini≈øter leaving his People, can never be ≈øatisfied in his own brea≈øt, that he ≈øhould leave them, and commit them, and not to know to whom; but when he knows with whom he hath committed them, when he hath delivered them over to God, that fir≈øt committed them to him, this is a great quietment and ≈øatisfaction to a Mini≈øter's ≈øpirit: God layes the people as a <hi>depo≈øitum,</hi> and will require an account of them at the la≈øt day. Now when a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øter is taken from his people, he cannot be ≈øatisfied, till he hath deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back his tru≈øt to God: Lord, here they are, and while I was with them, I did what I could; but now I am taken from them, here I ≈øurrender them back into thy hand; when I was in the world, I kept them in thy Name: And ≈øo it is be≈øt for the people to be left to ≈øuch a one who will keep them in all their Dangers, and comfort them in all their Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How ≈øhould a people be commended to God?</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. By Exhortation.</item>

            </list>
            <p>Fir≈øt, By Exhortation. Thus the Apo≈øtle before and after my Text. And then by Prayer, for ≈øo doth Saint <hi>Paul. Calvin</hi> looks upon tho≈øe Words, as a Prayer brought in, <hi>Always making mention of you in my Prayers,</hi> Rom. 1.19. Phil. 1.4. Col. 1.3.</p>
            <p>And I tru≈øt that I ≈øhall not only now, at this ≈øolemn departure, but as long as I live, ≈øtill recommend you into the hands of God; though I ≈øhall not preach to you, yet I ≈øhall ≈øtill make mention of you in my Prayers,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:203"/>that God would ≈øtabli≈øh, and comfort, and pre≈øerve you to his heavenly Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Why doth the Apo≈øtle commend them to the Word of his Grace? For the≈øe two Rea≈øons:</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Becau≈øe all the good that any people can look for, is from God; it is declared and laid up in the Promi≈øes, and in the Go≈øpel; there is the Trea≈øure of God, it is in the Go≈øpel; <hi>The grace of God which hath appeared to all men, bringeth ≈øalvation, Tit.</hi> 2.11. We could never have known of the glorious my≈øteries of Salvation, had it not been for the grace of God; we could never have expected good, but from the Go≈øpel: that is the great <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> wherein God hath made over what≈øoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the eternal good of his people. We have nothing to ≈øhew for grace, and comfort, and heaven, and glory, but his Go≈øpel. That is the great deed of gift that God hath given to his People: poor ≈øinners might look a Saviour, if the Word of God had not revealed it; tho≈øe people have no ground to expect Salvation, if God had not declared it in his Go≈øpel to be≈øtow it upon them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Go≈øpel is the only in≈øtrument by which God brings, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys all that good to the Soul that it ≈øtands in need of, all ≈øpiritual and temporal good that accompanies ≈øalvation.</p>
            <p>God works nothing immediately to the Soul, but by the Go≈øpel.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, If any ≈øoul be converted to God, it is by the grace of God: And as Conver≈øion, ≈øo Sanctification, that is effected by the word of God; ≈øo likewi≈øe is Edification, Salvation, and Pre≈øervation.</p>

It may be I have been too long already: but Gods knows that it may be the la≈øt time that I may tre≈øpa≈øs in this kind: and I have the Apo≈øtles example, who preached at <hi>Troas</hi> till midnight, but I promi≈øe to have done in a great deal le≈øs time.</p>

            <p>This I ≈øhall do, Fir≈øt, By exhorting and coun≈øel; and then by Prayer.</p>

               <item>1. In reference to God: and then</item>
               <item>2. In reference to the Word of his Grace.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Fir≈øt of all, my Exhortation in reference to God, is, That you would commit your ≈øelves to God; If it ≈øhould be ≈øo much a Mini≈øters care to
<pb facs="tcp:62760:204"/>commend his people to God, it's good rea≈øon they ≈øhould commend them≈øelves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Mini≈øters commending you to God, will be to no purpo≈øe, if you do not commit your ≈øelves. <hi>I ≈øhall alwayes make mention of you in my prayers,</hi> as long as God ≈øhall continue me in this valley of tears: <hi>I ≈øhall pray that God would build you up, and ≈øanctifie you:</hi> I ≈øhall pray for you; but God will not hear my Prayers, if you do not hearken to my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øel, <hi>To commit your ≈øelves to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Con≈øider, if you can ≈øo commit your ≈øelves to God, as to get God to take charge of you, you are made for ever.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God will be an All-≈øufficient God, in ≈øtead of all the friends in the world: you ≈øhall not need any that ≈øhall provide for you to protect you; God will be All in All, in ≈øtead of Father, in ≈øtead of Mother, Hou≈øes, Lands, Relations; God will be better to you than ten Husbands, than ten Mini≈øters; Ah, better than ten thou≈øand Worlds.</p>
            <p>God can ≈øweeten all your enjoyments, God can provide for you, and make you happy in the mid≈øt of the wants of Creature-comforts; God is a Sun, and a Shield, <hi>He will give grace and glory, and no good thing will he with-hold from them that fear him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God contains all in him≈øelf, <hi>Eminenter;</hi> get God, and you get all: Let the World frown or ≈ømile, let it turn up≈øide down. Though the Mountain be thrown into the mid≈øt of the Sea, though the World be ≈øet on fire, yet a Soul that is in Gods keeping is happy: <hi>God is a pre≈øent help in time of trouble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As God is an All-≈øufficient Friend, ≈øo he is a firm and fa≈øt Friend to them, <hi>My Father and Mother for≈øook me, but the Lord took me up, P≈øal.</hi> 27.10. My fle≈øh and my heart fails, but God fails me not; though my Mini≈øter and my Friend leave me, yet God will not leave me; he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by his own promi≈øe, truth; and faithfulne≈øs, <hi>I will never, (never, never) leave thee nor for≈øake thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you do not for≈øake God, God will never for≈øake you: if once you have ≈øo committed your ≈øelves to God, as God accepts the charge, he hath undertaken that you ≈øhall never depart from him: It is part of the Covenant, and he is engaged to all the Relations wherein he ≈øtands to his people, as a Husband, as a Father, as a Ma≈øter.</p>
            <p>But you will ≈øay, How ≈øhall we commit our ≈øelves to God, that God may have a charge of us? I will give you one Direction for all.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Take God to be your God, and give up your ≈øelves to be his people; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>f you will, before you and I part, heartily and unre≈øervedly give up your ≈øelves to God, to be his people, it will be the comfortable≈øt day that ever I
<pb facs="tcp:62760:204"/>≈øaw, though in other re≈øpects it may be the ≈øadde≈øt; As certainly God is your God, ≈øo certainly he will keep you; if you will avouch your ≈øelves to be Gods, I will avouch God to be yours.</p>
            <p n="1">1. You mu≈øt take God to be the portion of your ≈øouls inheritance, lay up all your happine≈øs in God; for if you chu≈øe any thing el≈øe for your happine≈øs but God, God will have nothing to do with you, God will be All or Nothing: Your hearts mu≈øt ≈øay as <hi>David</hi>'s, <hi>Lord thou art my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I de≈øire be≈øides thee.</hi> He accounted all nothing for God: God was his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈øs. God was his Portion, God was his All in All.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You mu≈øt make God the center of all your love and delight: God will have all from you, or nothing; you mu≈øt not divide your affection between God and the World, you mu≈øt love nothing in compari≈øon of him, love nothing but in ≈øubordination to him; as you would have God to be wholly yours, ≈øo you mu≈øt be wholly his.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You mu≈øt rake God to be the ≈øtrength and ≈øhield of hearts; As you would have God to take care of you, you mu≈øt ca≈øt your care upon God: If you place your hope any where el≈øe, there will be no ≈øure hold, the Anchor of your hope mu≈øt be ca≈øt no where el≈øe; if you lay your bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den any where el≈øe, God will not lend a finger to help you; but if you place your hope in God, God will help you; your extremity ≈øhall be his opportunity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. You mu≈øt take God to be the guide of your hearts; if you would have the priviledge of God's guard, you mu≈øt keep in Gods way; keep in Gods way, and you will be ≈øure of Gods protection; do you keep Gods precepts<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and God will keep your per≈øon; do what God commands, and avoid what God forbids, and then you need not fear what will become of you. Let the World frown, and Friends for≈øake you, re≈øolve that you will follow God where≈øoever he leads you, then he will be your God all your dayes, and he will guide you here by his coun≈øel, till at la≈øt he bring you to his glory: And this leads me to the ≈øecond Exhortation, in re≈øpect of the Go≈øpel.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Brethren, <hi>I commend you to the Word of Gods Grace.</hi> I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you to the Precepts of God, to be obeyed by you; I commend you to the Promi≈øes of God, to be believed by you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Keep them, &amp; hold them fa≈øt carefully it is your trea≈øure, &amp; life; keep it, and it will keep you; it is all that you can ≈øhew for Heaven: I leave it as a <hi>Depa≈øitum;</hi> if you part with it, take heed how you will an≈øwer it at the la≈øt day: it is the Talent which God hath committed to you, for which you will be commended for keeping at the great day. Hold fa≈øt the Word
<pb facs="tcp:62760:205"/>of God's grace; there is old tugging by the Devil and his in≈øtruments, either to pull you from the Word, or the Word from you. Let go any thing rather than the Go≈øpel; let go your Friends, your E≈øtates, your Lives, rather than let go the Go≈øpel.</p>
            <p>Study Gods Word, do not keep it by you for no purpo≈øe: <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them you hope for eternal life.</hi> There's the Pearl of great price, there is Directions, there is Comfort; this Book of God will make you wi≈øe unto Salvation.</p>
            <p>If you never hear Sermon more, you have enough by the u≈øe of the Bible to carry you to Heaven: There's Divinity, there is holine≈øs and Heaven almo≈øt in every ≈øyllable, when you cannot have it preached to you. Be much in the ≈øtudy of it.</p>
            <p>Then practice it con≈øcionably; Be not only Hearers but Doers of it; let your conver≈øation be ≈øuch as becomes the Go≈øpel. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Having then thus commended you to God, give me leave before we part to commend God and his Go≈øpel to you.</p>

               <item>2. Be much in the exerci≈øe of the Fear of the Lord all the day long; be afraid to ≈øin again≈øt God; in the ≈øecret of your ≈øouls mind his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence, in all places, in all company, in all bu≈øine≈ø≈øes.</item>

            <p>It is the comfort of a dying Father, when he ≈øees his children weeping round about him, that he can commend them to a Faithful Friend, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do that for them that he de≈øired to do, and a thou≈øand <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There are many poor ≈øouls that are yet in the gall of bitterne≈øs, and in the bond of iniquity; and if the Lord had ≈øeen good.

            </p>
            <p>It will be ≈øome alleviation of ≈øorrow, though I mu≈øt leave you, and dye to you as to my publick Mini≈øtry, that I hope I may a while go up and down, and conver≈øe with you, to be among you. The Lord grant this favour, that I may behold your ≈øtedfa≈øtne≈øs.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:206"/>2. This may be your comfort as well as mine; this may be the comfort of all tho≈øe poor Congregations that are like to be made Widows by the Metaphorical death of their Guides and Pa≈øtors; but I leave you into the hands of all Grace and of all Comfort.</p>
            <p>This is a black day upon <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> when ≈øo many faithful Mini≈øters are ≈ølain at one blow; this is a day of gloomine≈øs and darkne≈øs in many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, for ≈øo many Mini≈øters to be beheaded in one day!</p>
            <p>What hath <hi>England</hi> committed? Is it not ≈øome high Trea≈øon? If we look to the cau≈øe of it, why ≈øo many Mini≈øters, are as dead in one day, as ≈øo many Children without a Father.</p>
            <p>And if we look upon this cau≈øe what hath cau≈øed God thus to deal with us, we mu≈øt complain, Oh! our unfruitfulne≈øs! Our fearful unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs under the mercies of God: This will be the <hi>Empha≈øis</hi> and ≈øting of our grief; and this ≈øhould be the matter of our grief.</p>
            <p>And then, if we con≈øider the ≈øad Progno≈øtick, what it doth ≈øeem to foretel: It is a ≈øign, that when God lays a≈øide ≈øo many faithful Mini≈øters, of ≈øome ≈øcourge or calamity that is coming upon us.</p>
            <p>But you that can lament this Judgment, you that can lament the ≈øad deprivations of the≈øe powerful Ordinances; Remember, that though your Mini≈øter be dead, God can rai≈øe you up others in their ≈øtead; and where the way of in≈øtruments are wanting, He can do it without them; and tho≈øe that are begot in Chri≈øt, ≈øhall be pre≈øerved; and tho≈øe yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brought in, who belong to the Election of Grace, ≈øhall in Gods due time have the effectual work of the Spirit wrought upon their Souls. <hi>For he is able to build you up, and to give you an Inheritance among them that are ≈øan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though I take this ≈øolemn leave of you, as to this publick Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øe, yet if the Lord ≈øhall open the door, and take of tho≈øe bands of Death that the Law hath laid upon my Mini≈øtry in regard of Con≈øcience, who cannot Conform (for which our publick Mini≈øtry is ≈øu≈øpended) I ≈øhall chearfully and willingly return to you in this place.</p>
            <p>But now, though your dying Mini≈øter, in re≈øpect of the Exerci≈øe to his publick Mini≈øtry, is leaving of you, yet I commit you into a ≈øafe hand, <hi>I commend you to God, and to his Grace.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p>Before I fini≈øh, I ≈øhall endeavour to ≈øhew the whole light of this Text, in the≈øe ≈øix or ≈øeven Propo≈øitions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pro.</hi> 1. Fir≈øt, Je≈øus Chri≈øt takes notice of all the works, and trouble, and lo≈ø≈øes that we endure for him. There cannot be a godly word ≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but the Lord hears it, takes notice of it; not a day of humiliation, not a tear, not a prayer, not a ≈øigh, not a cup of cold water, but the Lord ≈øets it down: <hi>Item,</hi> At ≈øuch a time thou did≈øt lo≈øe ≈øuch a thing, hazard ≈øuch a concernment. Now this knowledge lies in two things:
<list>
                  <item>1. It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies an Approbation.</item>
                  <item>2. A Recompence: <hi>I know what thou doe≈øt,</hi> what thou ≈øuffere≈øt; ≈øo as to approve it, and ≈øo as to recompence it.</item>
               </list> Now then if God takes notice of what we do and ≈øuffer for his Name, then either we mu≈øt ≈øay, He hath not good enough, or not time enough to be≈øtow that good upon us, or not faithfulne≈øs enough to perform his promi≈øe, before we can be moved from his ≈øervice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pro.</hi> 2. Secondly, I ob≈øerve, Believers in their poor condition, when they have lo≈øt all, they are rich: <hi>I know thy poverty, but thou art rich.</hi> The only wi≈øe man is the only rich man, (≈øo ≈øaith the Philo≈øopher) but the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever is the rich man, (≈øo ≈øaith the wi≈ødom of God in the Text.) And the riches of a Believer lies in five things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In his intere≈øt, he hath a God for his portion: Faith doth unite and implant into the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt; ≈øo that we are become ≈øpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally rich to the utmo≈øt degree of happine≈øs: ≈øaith <hi>David, The lines are fallen to me in a plea≈øant place, I have a goodly heritage.</hi> All that rich love of God, which is ≈øtronger than death it ≈øelf: a rich Covenant of Grace ≈øhines in the Promi≈øes as ≈øo many Pearls; he will not with hold any thing that is good, nor ≈øuffer any thing that is evil to fall upon us, that ≈øhall not turn to good. How rich are they that are rich in God!</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:208"/>2. Believers mu≈øt needs be rich in their relations: <hi>Our Communion is with the Father, and with his Son Je≈øus Chri≈øt:</hi> They are married to Chri≈øt, and have an Intere≈øt in him, they mu≈øt certainly contract very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Allies, the Brother of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, a Member of Chri≈øt: ≈øhe that marries a Prince or King, is a Queen: What title of Honour ≈øhall we give to her that is e≈øpou≈øed to Je≈øus Chri≈øt?</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Believer is honourable in his po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions: To name but two, po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Grace, po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Peace: Grace and Peace, there is your riches; ≈øo the Lord ≈øalutes you in his Word: the lea≈øt dram of Grace is more than all the World. And this is the character of one that hungers and thir≈øts after Chri≈øt. And then for comforts which are grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on grace and the work of grace: for the ≈øpring of grace is a ≈øpring of joy: <hi>In the world you ≈øhall have trouble, but in me peace:</hi> And, <hi>in the mid≈øt of my troubled thoughts</hi> (≈øaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>thy comforts delight my Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. A Believer is rich in regard of his expectation, that Rever≈øion, that ble≈ø≈øed hope that is re≈øerved for him. A Believer his character is, to long and look for the appearance of Chri≈øt: The Believer is rich in the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la≈øting Kingdom of glory.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A Believer is rich in the things of this life: he can live above the≈øe things, he can be content without them; contentations is your riches: you ≈øhall want nothing that is good: Why then, have we not enough? And if we have enough, Why do we nor ≈øee our riches? Becau≈øe God doth not ≈øhake down the Acorns from the Tree of common providence, which he does to the herds of the World, but feeds us with Childrens bread, ≈øhall we therefore repine? Let us ≈øee our riches even in the things of this life. He that believes on Chri≈øt, is in ≈øuch a condition as can know no want: He that is not in Chri≈øt, cannot be rich: He that is in Chri≈øt, cannot be poor. Judge not of his condition by what he appears to be outwardly. A Believer is worth as much as the Promi≈øes come to, which are his Charter; as much as the Kingdom of Heaven comes to, which is his Rever≈øion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> 3. Chri≈øt takes notice of all the reproaches and bla≈øphemies of his Adver≈øaries: <hi>I know the bla≈øphemy of them that ≈øay they are Jews and are not, but are of the Synagogue of Satan.</hi> Chri≈øt counts him≈øelf reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched when his Servants and wayes are reproached: <hi>The reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</hi> A Chri≈øtian doth quarter Arms with Chri≈øt: Therefore, all the reproaches of the black mouths they are e≈øpecially taken notice of by Je≈øus Chri≈øt. There is not a word they can ≈øpeak, but is pre≈øently recorded among the <hi>memorandums</hi> of Je≈øus
<pb facs="tcp:62760:208"/>Chri≈øt. Repent, if it be po≈ø≈øible, that the word in thy tongue, the thought in thy mind may be forgiven; I ≈øay, if it be po≈ø≈øible, though a malicious Scoffer does ≈øeldom return.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> 4. What ever the Children of God ≈øuffer at any time before the Grave, they may ≈øuffer ≈øtill [<hi>I know thy works and tribulation (nay, yet the wind is not yet over)</hi> in the next ver≈øe <hi>thou ≈øhalt ≈øuffer.</hi>] After great expences of bloud and trea≈øure, ≈øtill more heavy calamities: the water of Tribulation doth ri≈øe higher and higher, till the Believer re≈øi≈øts unto bloud, ≈øtriving again≈øt ≈øin: you mu≈øt expect it, you mu≈øt go with your lives in your hands, re≈øolving upon the greate≈øt trouble, to wade through a deep floud of calamities, not one piece of the Cro≈øs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>

Whatever troubles come upon the people of God, they have no cau≈øe to fear: <hi>Fear none of the≈øe things thou ≈øhalt ≈øuffer: be careful for nothing:</hi> (it is very comprehen≈øive) there is a fear that we cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and there is a fear we may not admit: A fear there is of dependence, this furthers our preparation, prayer, renouncing our ≈øelves, flying to the Lord Je≈øus under his wings: that is a ble≈ø≈øed fear of trouble, that makes us to come nearer to God: But then there is a fear of de≈øponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, Apo≈øta≈øie, a fear of Di≈øtraction, ≈øo as to be di≈ømayed, di≈øcouraged. There is no ground of ≈øalvi≈øh fear as to God; no ground of a fear of man, of any thing that man can do to us: And the Rea≈øon is,</p>
            <list>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:209"/>
               <item>1. All our ≈øufferings are ordered by a Father: 'tis the potion that thy Father gives thee to drink: what ever bitter ingredient there is in it, ≈øtill its of thy Fathers procuring: why, wilt thou ≈øu≈øpect it to be poy≈øon, and be afraid of it? no, be encouraged.</item>
               <item>2. Fear not, Chri≈øt ≈øtands by thee in all thy ≈øufferings: The Angel ≈øtood by Chri≈øt in his Agony to comfort him: but Chri≈øt ≈øtands by us in our Agony, in our contending for the Faith: <hi>Fear not</hi> (≈øaith God) <hi>O worm</hi> Jacob, <hi>I will be with thee:</hi> He is alwayes with us, though ≈øometimes as to ≈øen≈øe 'tis otherwi≈øe: nay, if Chri≈øt be nearer to us at any time, 'tis when trouble is mo≈øt near us. (<hi>O Lord be not far off, for trouble is near,</hi> ≈øaith the <hi>P≈øalmi≈øt.</hi>) That trouble is ble≈ø≈øed that engages God to be nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to us, that engages us to come nearer to God.</item>
               <item>3. Fear not: Whatever 'tis that we ≈øuffer, there ≈øhall be ≈øufficient ≈øtrength given to bear it, to go through it: God will never lay more upon thee than he will enable thee to bear: and if thy ≈øtrength be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øed proportionably, it is all one to lift a pound weight, and to lift an hundred pound weight.</item>
               <item>4. Fear not any of the≈øe ≈øufferings, becau≈øe none of them ≈øhall hurt thee; God hath ≈øaid, he will ≈øtave all evil from thee <hi>(no evil ≈øhall come nigh thy dwelling) and he that fears the Lord ≈øhall not be vi≈øited of any evil,</hi> Prov. 19.23. No hurt ≈øhall come, nothing ≈øhall come to thee ami≈øs (that is, as to thy Soul, and the Soul is the man; there ≈øhall be no impairing to thy Soul, to thy be≈øt intere≈øt; thou ≈øhalt lo≈øe nothing but that thou can≈øt not keep, nothing that enters into the other world to make up thy happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs; thou ≈øhalt lo≈øe nothing to do thee good; no lo≈øs of communion with God, no lo≈øs of Grace, Peace, and Comfort; thy intere≈øt ≈øhall not be ≈øhaken, thy Communion ≈øhall not be dimini≈øhed.</item>
            </list>
            <p>But why do I ≈øpeak of no hurt? there ≈øhall come a great deal of good by the≈øe troubles. When God calls thee to ≈øuffer, and thou wilt put him off with doing, make it up that way, God lo≈øes by it, and thou do≈øt lo≈øe that thou do≈øt; but if you will buckle your ≈øelf to that ≈øervice God calls for; active when 'tis active, pa≈ø≈øive when 'tis pa≈ø≈øive; this is that piece of godline≈øs that is <hi>great gain.</hi> Thou wilt either live or die, and ≈øhalt gain both wayes; if thou live≈øt, thy Graces ≈øhall be better, the Spirit of God ≈øhall be upon thee; if thou die, thy Glory, which is weighty, ≈øhall be double; the weightier the Cro≈øs, the weightier the Crown: be content to go as Chri≈øt did, from the Cro≈øs to the Crown. Let us ≈øtrive again≈øt our carnal Lu≈øts, tho≈øe ≈øew things that are ready to choak our faith, di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage God, and cut the ≈øinews of our endeavours to any ≈øervice God calls us to.</p>

Con≈øider our troubles are like to be great: here is the Symptom of Gods di≈øplea≈øure upon us, here is the pouring out of ≈øuch a providence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, as is u≈øually attended with de≈øtructive Judgments. <hi>Sodoms</hi> cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity was coming; when one <hi>Lot</hi> was di≈øcharged: <hi>Germany</hi>'s calamities was coming, when one <hi>Luther</hi> was taken away; Lord then what woe is this, to ≈øweep away ≈øo many faithful, painful Labourers at once! but it is our duty to ≈øuffer patiently, and not complain.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As our troubles mu≈øt be great, ≈øo many will fear, and in fearing faint; we ≈øee it come to pa≈øs, and you will find it more and more: There are tho≈øe that run with the Foot-men, that will not keep pace with the Hor≈øe-men, that may be left behind, and be trod under foot: our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are likely to ri≈øe according to all we can learn from Scripture and Providence, and very many there be that will ≈øhrink.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Con≈øider it is a very difficult thing to ≈øtand ≈øtedfa≈øt in a day of evil; you cannot name any of God's Children, but when they have indeed come to it, their carnal ≈øears have been working ≈øo, <hi>as their feet have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt ≈ølipt,</hi> they have been almo≈øt gone, but that for the promi≈øe of God, that he would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>y no more upon them than he would enable them to bear.</p>
            <p>O but you will ≈øay, What will become of the publick intere≈øt, of the name and Church of God? and what ≈øhall become of my private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt?</p>
            <p>I an≈øwer, you have no ground of fear (according to Scripture) in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the≈øe re≈øpects.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, as to the publick Name of God, the intere≈øt of his Church, of his truth, of righteou≈ønes, or of a real Reformation, the intere≈øt of our prayers and hopes, be not afraid.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God bears a dear re≈øpect unto his People: they are repre≈øented in Scripture by all names that may import dearne≈øs and nearne≈øs imto him: the intere≈øt of his glory is bound up in his people: he calls <hi>I≈ørael</hi> his <hi>Glory:</hi> We know the intere≈øt of men is that which moves the world: but the intere≈øt of God, of his Glory, no doubt will be the ground of ≈øafety and ≈øecurity unto us, even till God takes us to Heaven. For the intere≈øt of Gods Ju≈øtice God made Hell; and for the intere≈øt of his mercy and grace, be gave Je≈øus Chri≈øt to die, to take effect here among the children of men; Do you think God will forget his intere≈øt?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Remember, Gods ways are in the deep: you cannot tell what God is doing; when you think thoughts of de≈øtruction and confu≈øion, my thoughts towards you, ≈øaith God, are thoughts of peace: And truly God he does not ≈øave a Soul, nor does not promote the ≈øalvation of
<pb facs="tcp:62760:210"/>his Church in any eminent degree but it is in a way that is cro≈øs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ≈øen≈øe and expectation of fle≈øh and blood: in≈øomuch you know the darkne≈øs of our condition has been the entrance upon delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; as ju≈øt before the day dawns, it is the darke≈øt of the night; when God looked and there was none to help them, ≈øays he, <hi>My arm brought ≈øalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it was with you that are effectually called: you have received the ≈øentence of death; the entrance upon your deliverance, is the darke≈øt time of your condition.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God can do great things, <hi>Joel.</hi> 2. <hi>Fear not, thy God, O Sion, can do great things.</hi> 'Tis a di≈øparagement that we offer to God, we a≈øcribe more to the Creature than we do to God, when we give way to carnal fear; fear not what man can do, becau≈øe of the power of God which is his ≈øhield and buckler; Is any thing too hard, too heavy for God? And when God does great things, he u≈øually goes on to do greater; though he may ≈øeem to ≈øuffer his work to be thrown back to confu≈øion, and his people may be ready to ≈øay, we thought he had redeemed <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> that degree of Reformation ≈øhall not be lo≈øt. You know in <hi>Luthers</hi> time, take any ≈øpecial degree of Reformation in the Church, and it ≈øeemed to be oppo≈øed by the gates of Hell: when it was brought upon the ≈øtage to any hopeful degree, when it was taken as it were utterly out of ≈øight for a while: but it was never lo≈øt: thus God is but making way for his own glory to appear in the≈øe great works.</p>
            <p>O, but you will ≈øay, What ≈øhall become of my particular? It is enough God hath promi≈øed that we ≈øhall not want any thing that is truly good, and that nothing that is evil ≈øhall fall upon us, and lye upon us: though we do not ≈øee deliverance, it ≈øhall be: what≈øoever our ≈øad thoughts and tremblings of heart may be, yet give God the glory of his Word: Take the≈øe few directions:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Strive to ≈øtrengthen thy Faith. Faith is that which lays hold on Chri≈øt, and Chri≈øt is your ≈øtrength: therefore Faith is ≈øaid to do that which Chri≈øt doth: let every day drive thee to a renewed Act of Faith: Take heed, be not ≈øhaken in the Faith of the Cau≈øe, be not ≈øhaken in the Faith of Chri≈øt <hi>(fides cau≈øae, fides Chri≈øti)</hi> Be not ≈øhaken upon the Cau≈øe, which upon utmo≈øt examination we find to be according to the Word, hold that: <hi>Heaven and Earth ≈øhall pa≈øs away, but not one jot and tittle of this Cau≈øe.</hi> And then do not ≈øhake in the faith of Chri≈øt, that is, in your laying hold in your applying your ≈øelves to him, in your re≈øting and ≈øettling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; beg of God to ≈øtrengthen your Faith.</item>
               <item>2. Get more Self-denial: we mu≈øt for≈øake all, we mu≈øt not accept any
<pb facs="tcp:62760:210"/>thing. A man would part with his life, as ea≈øily as with a pin off his ≈øleeve, if he had but ≈øome con≈øiderable growth in Self-denial.</item>
               <item>3. Get a great deal of love towards that Chri≈øt that loved us with love ≈øtronger than death: get love of that Chri≈øt that may be ≈øtronger than life. Let nothing in the world be of any con≈øideration with you, ≈øo as Chri≈øt be magnified in your bodies: love will breed courage, and ca≈øt out fear: ≈ølavi≈øh fear before God, carnal fear before me.</item>
               <item>4. Get a true in≈øight in, an account of ≈øuffering and troubles whence they are: they i≈ø≈øue from the ≈øame love with redemption of your ≈øouls from Hell, and your glorification: God doth every thing in pur≈øuance of the purpo≈øe of his love: he doth every thing according to the platform and pattern of his thoughts towards us from eternity. Confider what troubles are, and to what end, not to de≈øtroy, but to try: to wean from the world, to fit for heaven.</item>
               <item>5. Get an in≈øight into the vanity of the Creature: you reckon the Creature ≈øome great matter, and that is the rea≈øon of your love, and of your fear.</item>
               <item>6. Get the fear of God, that may over-rule other fears: <hi>Fear not him that can but kill the body, but fear him that is able to ca≈øt Body and Soul into Hell-fire.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>7. Keep a clear con≈øcience void of offence towards God, and towards men: by a heart-aba≈øing confe≈ø≈øion of what is pa≈øt, and the application of the blood of Chri≈øt; and by mortification and watchfulne≈øs therein, keep your ≈øelves from evil for the time to come.</item>
               <item>8. Get a better a≈ø≈øurance of eternal life; a glimp≈øe and ≈øight of this would make a man run through the very flames of hell. How comfortable was <hi>Stephen,</hi> when a ≈øhower of ≈øtones was about his ears, to ≈øee Je≈øus ≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the right hand of God! I wonder how they dare to venture their life, that have no ground of a better life: but for tho≈øe that have a well grounded hope of the mercy of God, they ≈øay, We reckon the≈øe light afflictions, which are but for a moment, to work for us a far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and eternal weight of glory. <hi>Fear not any of the≈øe things which you ≈øhall ≈øuffer.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> 7. Chri≈øt does limit Satan, he hath him in a ≈øtring, him and all his in≈øtruments: (<hi>The Devil ≈øhall ca≈øt ≈øome of you into pri≈øon,</hi> &amp;c.) Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word hath its weight: who ≈øhall do it? <hi>the Devil:</hi> What ≈øhall he do? <hi>ca≈øt you into pri≈øon.</hi> How far! <hi>≈øome of you:</hi> How long? <hi>ten dayes:</hi> For what u≈øe? <hi>that you may be tryed.</hi> Chri≈øt as he hath Satan in a chain of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, ≈øo he hath a chain of Re≈øtraint; it is Chri≈øt that ≈øets a circle about him, he cannot cau≈øe a hair of thy head to fall: he is in the hand of
<pb facs="tcp:62760:211"/>Chri≈øt; they are as truly under him and his hand, as they are again≈øt him: If God let alone his Enemies, what ≈øhall they not do? If God let alone his People, what ≈øhall they do?</p>
            <p n="2">2. God has a ≈øpecial Providence about the things of his Church by way of Eminency, by way of Premi≈ø≈øion, and ordination.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You will not deny but there's power enough in God to de≈øtroy all that are again≈øt him, and to limit; and all ≈øhall make to the prai≈øe of God, and to his peoples good.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Lord is exceeding merciful; he cannot hold when the Enemy comes to in≈øult, to bla≈øpheme, and revile: <hi>Now will I ari≈øe,</hi> ≈øaith God, <hi>and ≈øet him at liberty from him that puffeth at him:</hi> there is not only a judging of their Enemies hereafter, but a judging of them here: <hi>the world ≈øhall ≈øay, Verily there is a God that rewardeth righteou≈øne≈øs, verily there is a God that judgeth the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. God hath a ≈øpecial de≈øign in hand: therefore ju≈øt ≈øo far as he will carry on the de≈øign God hath towards his people (which is always a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign of Faithfulne≈øs) ju≈øt ≈øo far ≈øhall the enemy go, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 10. The Enemy means not ≈øo, he means to cut off people, not a few; but Gods end was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi≈øe, and he will over-rule them: this is the comfort, there is a ≈øet time, there is an end.</p>
            <p>There is a difference between the afflicting of God's people, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Enemies: in the intention, and exten≈øion: one is for ruine, the other in proportion: one is a light affliction, the other a load. And then for exten≈øion, one is for ever, the other, is for a time, for <hi>ten dayes.</hi> Then our affliction ≈øhall have an end, I and a comfortable end, the end of our ≈øins, and the end of our ≈øorrows? God will re≈øtore comforts to his mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; let us be mourners during the time of mourning: God will quickly cloath us with garments of prai≈øe: there ≈øhall be an end of ≈øufferings, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver an end of our joy and glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> 8. To conclude in a word, <hi>Be faithful to the death:</hi> Be faithful in your Promi≈øes, in your vows and purpo≈øes, your covenants of obedience and reformation; per≈øi≈øt in the doctrine of the Go≈øpel, and the wor≈øhip of the Go≈øpel, and the Mini≈øtry of the Go≈øpel, and Offices Chri≈øt hath fixt in his Church: be faithful by your mo≈øt earne≈øt, zealous de≈øires before the Lord: <hi>Be faithful to the death:</hi> he will never let you ≈øee death till all your fears are conquered: he can pre≈øently take them away; he will certainly be pre≈øent with you in all your troubles. And remember, God in tender mercy and faithfulne≈øs, for the pre≈øent accepts thy unfeigned purpo≈øe to be con≈øtant and faithful to him to the death.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>
                  <hi>Joh. 14.23.</hi>
               </bibl>
               <q>Je≈øus an≈øwered and ≈øaid unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words; and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THe departure of <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt</hi> unto his Father, from who≈øe bo≈øom he came into the World, was very ≈øadly re≈øented by his Di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, who≈øe mixt pa≈ø≈øions produce a very great di≈øturbance and trouble upon their Spirits.</p>
            <p>The inward Anxiety, and unconcealed grief of the Di≈øciples, move the Bowels of their more affectionate Lord to pity their ca≈øe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for their relief, and give them in≈øtructions how to expre≈øs their love unto him in his ab≈øence, not ≈øo much in carrying blubber'd eyes and heavy hearts, as by remembring and ob≈øerving the Coun≈øels and In≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that he hath given to them, while he was pre≈øent with them. So that this whole Chapter is fill'd up with Coun≈øels and Comforts, Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Con≈øolations.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Directions and Coun≈øels, e≈øpecially in the 1.13.15. <hi>ver≈øes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, To the exerci≈øe of Faith, <hi>ver≈øe</hi> 1. <hi>Ye believe in God, believe al≈øo in me.</hi> And this is the life, even a life of Faith, which we mu≈øt live, till we come to the enjoyment of <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> by which we fetch comforts in all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and ≈øtrength again≈øt all tentations, from <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, To the duty of Prayer, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. which is the proper duty of an afflicted State, as <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Is any afflicted? let him pray.</hi> By Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the Soul empties his Complaints in Gods bo≈øome, and finds ea≈øe by telling him of all the trouble and grief that attends his ≈øtate; Prayer hath that divine excellency, that, like a heavenly Charm, it ≈øpeaks away trouble, and ≈øpeaks in comfort; as 'tis ≈øaid of <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.18. <hi>She prayed, and went away, and did eat, and her countenance was no more ≈øad;</hi> And thus our Prayers alwayes ≈øpeed, when they be made by the help of the Spirit, and offered up to God in the name of <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> 13, 14. ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes
<pb facs="tcp:62760:212"/>
               <hi>What≈øoever ye ask the Father in my name, that you ≈øhall receive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, To obedience in the 15. ver≈øe, to do the work committed to them: <hi>If ye love me keep my commandements.</hi> You cannot better expre≈øs your love to me, than in keeping my words. Nor is there a more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain way for men to find comfort, than this, <hi>by keeping his commands:</hi> for then, though they cannot enjoy his Per≈øon, yet they ≈øhall not mi≈øs his Promi≈øe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Con≈øolation which he gives them in the 2. ver. &amp;c. the 16. ver. &amp;c. and the 23. ver. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, In the 2, 3, 4, ver. &amp;c. From the place whether he was going, <hi>to his Father and their Father, his Home and their Home;</hi> whence he did intend to come again to them. So that his going from them, was but a Rece≈øs, or with-drawing for a time, until he came: For in <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>I will come again, and receive you to my ≈øelf;</hi> as rendred in the Greek, <hi>I come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi> in the Pre≈øent Ten≈øe, to intimate the certainty of his coming to them again, as if he were already come; which in <hi>ver.</hi> 28. of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Chri≈øt tells them, ≈øhould be matter of great joy to them. <hi>If ye loved me, ye would rejoyce, becau≈øe I ≈øaid, I go unto the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, From <hi>ver.</hi> 16. The promi≈øe of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which ≈øhall ≈øupply his ab≈øence: ≈øuch a <hi>Spirit</hi> as ≈øhall reach them, comfort them, and be in ≈øtead of All to them, give them ≈øuch Joy, Courage, and Peace, as the World can neither give, nor take away, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. <hi>Peace I leave with you, my Peace I give unto you, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, In the 23. <hi>ver.</hi> in the Text, <hi>We will come and make our abode with him,</hi> while you keep my words, which is the great promi≈øe here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If a man love me, he will keep my words, and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The words of the Text are an An≈øwer to the Que≈øtion of Judas, (not I≈øcariot) Lord how is it, that thou wilt manife≈øt thy ≈øelf unto us, and not unto the world?</hi> Je≈øus Chri≈øt <hi>gives the An≈øwer, If a man love me he will keep my words, &amp;c.</hi> To him the Promi≈øe is made, That the <hi>Father</hi> will love him: They love him that keep his words; and to the≈øe he hath ≈øaid, <hi>He will manife≈øt his love to them, and make his abode with them.</hi> In which word there are three parts con≈øiderable.</p>

And ≈øo <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 3.8. <hi>accounts all dung,</hi> his parts, his righteou≈øne≈øs by the Law, his greate≈øt excellencies; he loves Chri≈øt in <hi>deed,</hi> and not in <hi>≈øhew</hi> only, who can leave the world, his deare≈øt lu≈øts, his be≈øt righteou≈øne≈øs for Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>This is a true conjugal love, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 45.10. <hi>Hearken O daughter, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fider, and encline thine ear, forget al≈øo thine own people,</hi> &amp;c. When Chri≈øt ≈øees that we have ≈øuch love to him, that we will part with all for him, then he ≈øees a beauty in us that delights him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He truly loves Je≈øus Chri≈øt, who having received him will rather lo≈øe all, than part with him again; who accounts Je≈øus Chri≈øt bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than his be≈øt things, as he ≈øayes, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.37. <hi>He that loves Father or Mother more than me, is not worthy of me,</hi> &amp;c. therefore ≈øayes the Spou≈øe, Cant. 8.6. <hi>Set me as a ≈øeal upon thine heart, as a ≈øeal upon thine arm, let me be ≈øo united to thee, that I may never be ≈øever'd from thee.</hi> It is a very
<pb facs="tcp:62760:213"/>hard le≈ø≈øon, and an irk≈øome duty for the be≈øt of men, to part with friends, liberty, peace, life, all the≈øe, or either of the≈øe ≈øweet mercies; but to part with <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> nothing can per≈øwade, or enforce the ≈øoul that truly loves him; that's a thought more cruel than the Grave, witne≈øs the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Martyrs, a whole cloud of witne≈ø≈øes; that notable and eminent <hi>Galea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> Marque≈øs of <hi>Vico,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He that truly loves <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> takes abundance of delight in communion with him. No plea≈øure like the ki≈ø≈øes of his mouth, No ≈øweetne≈øs like that of his bo≈øome; all his ways are peace, and his paths plea≈øantne≈øs; Chri≈øt makes every condition comfortable, there is no comfort of life, but in that little enjoyment of Chri≈øt that the ≈øoul hath in his life: 'tis <hi>communion</hi> with <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> conver≈øe with him, that is all my comfort and plea≈øure in the world. O how doth the Spou≈øe take care that he be not di≈øturbed, in <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>I charge you, O ye daughters of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru≈øalem, by the Roes and the Hinds of the field, that ye ≈øtir not up, nor awake my Love, till he plea≈øe.</hi> The words are an allu≈øion to one that would not have her Friend di≈øturbed, and ≈øpeaks to her companions, and charges them by all that is dear and plea≈øant to them, not to break the re≈øt of her be≈øt Beloved, and ≈øhews the wonderful delight the ≈øoul takes in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and the ≈øpecial care that it alwayes hath, that no tentation break in, nor corruption break out, to interrupt that ≈øweet communion, or occa≈øion Chri≈øts departure, who will not for any profit commit any ≈øin, or cau≈øe Je≈øus to depart from him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He that truly loves Je≈øus Chri≈øt, having lo≈øt the ≈øight of him, is never ≈øatisfied, till he come to the re-enjoyment of him, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes at a lo≈øs, and is never quiet till he enter into acquaintance and communion with him, as in that of <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> they having lo≈øt their Son, went ≈øeeking till they found him; So <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, &amp;c. <hi>By night on my bed, I ≈øought him whom my ≈øoul loveth, I ≈øought him, but I found him not: I will ri≈øe now and go about the City, in the ≈øtreets, and in the broad ways,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I ≈øaid to the Watchmen, Saw ye him whom my ≈øoul loveth?</hi> &amp;c. By all which is expre≈ø≈øed the ≈øedulous care and indu≈øtry of a living ≈øoul ≈øeeking after Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, <hi>By night in her bed.</hi> Je≈øus Chri≈øt hath her be≈øt thoughts; in her clo≈øet and private duties of Prayer, ≈øerious Meditations, ≈øpiritual Ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and ≈øecret ≈øelf-Examinations: in all the≈øe the ≈øoul enquires: As one that loves the world, by night his meditation is of the world; ≈øo the man of plea≈øures and honours is pur≈øuing his lu≈øts in the night ≈øea≈øon; the <hi>wicked man is contriving mi≈øchief upon his bed:</hi> ≈øo the ≈øoul that loves Chri≈øt, his are ≈øtill at work after Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:213"/>Secondly, <hi>I will ri≈øe now and go about the City,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>(i.e.)</hi> I will betake my ≈øelf to all publick Ordinances, and ≈øhew more zeal and life in my duties, and in the≈øe I will make enquiry.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>I asked the Watchmen,</hi> the Mini≈øters of the Go≈øpel, which are, or ≈øhould be as <hi>faithful watchmen,</hi> that watch for our Souls, and be able <hi>to ≈øpeak a word in ≈øea≈øon,</hi> &amp;c. So nothing will ≈øatisfie the Soul that truly loves Chri≈øt, without him; and no means ≈øhall be negected till ≈øhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Why mu≈øt he be thus beloved?</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Becau≈øe he is lovely, <hi>altogether lovely.</hi>

            <list>
               <item>Fir≈øt, Lovely in his <hi>Life,</hi> ob≈øerving all the will of <hi>God,</hi> there was a wonderful beauty upon him, if we behold and can under≈øtand, that hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den glory of an untainted Holine≈øs, and exact conformity to the will of God.</item>
               <item>Secondly, Lovely in his <hi>Death,</hi> never more lovely and amiable to the believing ≈øinner, than when he was mo≈øt de≈øpicable in the eyes of rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ≈øinners. O then he appears mo≈øt beautiful and de≈øirable, when he hangs on the Cro≈øs, there making our Peace, procuring our pardon, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taning life and glory for us, by that ≈øhameful death.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, Lovely in all his <hi>Graces,</hi> each Grace a matchle≈øs Jewel; Rocks of Diamonds, Mountains of Pearl, not worthy to be mentioned with the lea≈øt of his excellencies.

               </item>
               <item>Fourthly, Lovely in all his <hi>Ordinances,</hi> in which the more immediate ≈øight the Soul hath of him, the more he is taken with his Beauty; No wonder he is called in <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.7. <hi>The de≈øire of all Nations.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Secondly, Becau≈øe of his de≈øerving love; <hi>We love him, becau≈øe he fir≈øt loved us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Con≈øider in his love, the≈øe four particulars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Fir≈øt, He laid down his life for us, ≈øuch a love will de≈øerve love, and life too; <hi>John</hi> 15.13. <hi>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Secondly, He lives now in Heaven for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>He ever liveth to make interce≈ø≈øion for us.</hi> He is there minding our nece≈ø≈øities, agitating our affairs; by his ≈øitting there, we have Liberty of coming thither; his ≈øit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting there in glory, we have our ≈øtanding here in grace.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, he accounts that as done to him≈øelf, that is done to them
<pb facs="tcp:62760:214"/>that are his, <hi>Zach.</hi> 2.8. <hi>He that toucheth you, toucheth the Apple of his eye,</hi> and <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.40, 41, 42. &amp;c. <hi>He that receiveth you, receiveth me:</hi> and ≈øo he ≈øaid to <hi>Saul,</hi> Acts 9.4. <hi>Why per≈øecute≈øt thou me?</hi> when he was with commi≈ø≈øion from the <hi>High Prie≈øt,</hi> dragging the poor Profe≈ø≈øors of <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt</hi> to the pri≈øon.</item>
               <item>Fourthly, He longs to have us with him, <hi>John</hi> 17.24. <hi>Father I will that where I am, there they may be al≈øo, to behold my glory.</hi> He is not ≈øatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with out their Company: and is always imparting his mo≈øt ≈øecret coun≈øels to them, <hi>John</hi> 15.16. <hi>Henceforth I call you not Servants, for the ≈øervant knoweth not what his Lord doth; but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Thirdly, Becau≈øe otherwi≈øe we ≈øhall not regard his words which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated in the Text, <hi>If we love him, we ≈øhall keep his words;</hi> but if we love him not, we will not keep his words; It is want of Love to Chri≈øt, that is the cau≈øe of the abounding of every ≈øin; for if we did love him, we ≈øhould keep his commands, which is the ≈øecond particular.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>What it is to keep the words of Chri≈øt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, There is a <hi>Natural and Mental keeping of the words of Chri≈øt:</hi> and ≈øo we mu≈øt keep them, that is, <hi>Remember his Words, his Promi≈øes, Coun≈øels and Appointments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Memory is man's ≈øtorehou≈øe, or cabinet, that ≈øhould be kept Sacred for the truths of Chri≈øt; ≈øo the Di≈øciples kept the word of Chri≈øt, when they remembred his ≈øayings; and <hi>David,</hi> P≈ø. 119.93. <hi>I will never forget thy precepts, for by them thou ha≈øt quickened me,</hi> (i.e.) <hi>I will keep thy precepts;</hi> for what we forget we lo≈øe, and what we remember, we keep. And thus, as Friends take plea≈øure to look ≈øometimes on the love-tokens of their ab≈øent friends; So may we have ≈øingular comfort and refre≈øhment, to ≈øee the heart of Chri≈øt in the coun≈øels, promi≈øes, and appointments left with us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is an <hi>Evangilical and Practical keeping of the words of Chri≈øt.</hi> When we do believe promi≈øes, and obey commands; <hi>Promi≈øes not believed, and precepts not obeyed, are as water ≈øpilt on the earth be≈øides the Ve≈ø≈øel that ≈øhould receive it,</hi> Heb. 4.2. but when they are believed, <hi>they be as liquor put into the Ve≈ø≈øel for its proper u≈øe.</hi> Hence ≈øaith Chri≈øt, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.28. <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.</hi> Then we keep the words of Chri≈øt, when we believe his promi≈øes, ob≈øerve his precepts in all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øation, and walk by his appointments and in≈øtitutions in all our duties.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Why? it is their Property and Duty that love <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> to keep his words.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:214"/>Fir≈øt, Becau≈øe <hi>true love is comprehen≈øive:</hi> He that loves Chri≈øt truly, loves al≈øo all that is his; <hi>He that loves him that begat, loves him al≈øo that is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:</hi> The nearer any thing is to Chri≈øt, the better it is beloved, and then we love the Word, when we keep it as a ≈øpecial pledge of his love; <hi>To have his Word, and a heart to keep it, is a double ble≈ø≈øing:</hi> and indeed, ≈øuch a gift is the Word of Chri≈øt, as wordly to be loved for it ≈øelf, and kept for the Givers ≈øake.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becau≈øe <hi>true love is Operative,</hi> It is the principle of Go≈øpel-obedience, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. <hi>The love of Chri≈øt con≈øtraineth us.</hi> Where there is the di≈øpo≈øition of a Son, there will be obedience to the Fathers commands<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> ≈øo where there is ≈øpiritual love to <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> it will ≈øet the Soul on work, and quicken it to keep the words of Chri≈øt. As is ≈øaid of Faith, <hi>Shew me thy Faith by thy Works:</hi> So, ≈øhew thy love to Chri≈øt by thy works; as Faith without works is dead, ≈øo is love without obedience.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becau≈øe keeping the words of Chri≈øt gives the cleare≈øt and ≈øure≈øt te≈øtimony of the truth of our love to Je≈øus Chri≈øt. <hi>Probatio dilectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis e≈øt exhibitio operis,</hi> Obedience is the mo≈øt lively te≈øtification of love, as Chri≈øt ≈øaid to <hi>Peter, Love≈øt thou me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>≈øhew it in this, in doing thy duty, Feed my ≈øheep.</hi> So Chri≈øt tells us in the Text, <hi>Where the fire of love is in the brea≈øt, there the flames of duty and ≈øervice is in the hand,</hi> Joh. 15.14. <hi>Ye are my friends, if ye do what≈øoever I command you.</hi> In the 1 Joh. 5.3. <hi>In this is the love of God, that we keep his Commandements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øe</hi> 1. For Exhortation.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, To a mental keeping of the words of <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> according to that word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1. <hi>We ought therefore to give the more diligent heed to the things which we have received, le≈øt at any time we let them ≈ølip.</hi> And that we may not forget, but keep in our memories the words of <hi>Chri≈øt;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, con≈øider, That all the promi≈øes and coun≈øels which <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt</hi> hath made known to us, are not only for the pre≈øent, but for the future u≈øe, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 22.23. <hi>Hearken and hear for the time to come.</hi> We ≈øhould hear as if we were to hear no more. The Cordial which hath ≈øometime revived us, mu≈øt not be lain a≈øide, le≈øt for want of it another time, we faint quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. The rea≈øon why they were ready to faint under afflictions, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5. was, <hi>becau≈øe they had forgotten the Exhortation, which ≈øpeaketh to them as to Sons.</hi> For this cau≈øe Je≈øus Chri≈øt often bids his Di≈øciples <hi>remember the word he had ≈øpoken to them,</hi> and knowing their frailty, promi≈øes his Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.26. <hi>and that</hi> (≈øays he) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>≈øhall bring to his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, con≈øider, Not to remember the words of <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> is a ≈øad ≈øign of our di≈ø-e≈øteem of <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> We u≈øually remember Precepts,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:215"/>Coun≈øels, and Sayings, according to the authority which the per≈øon hath with us, from whence they come. It is a very great di≈øhonour to Je≈øus Chri≈øt, when he ≈øhall ca≈øt his words behind our backs. Did we honour Je≈øus Chri≈øt as our <hi>King, Lord,</hi> and <hi>Law-giver,</hi> we ≈øhould be more careful to remember what he hath ≈øpoken to us. We often blame our Heads, as if the fault lay only there, that we do not remember the words of Chri≈øt, when indeed the fault lies mo≈øt in the Hearts, that we have not more and e≈øteem of Chri≈øt there.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The time will come, when we ≈øhall dearly repent every Truth forgotten, that we did not endeavour <hi>to ≈øeal in≈øtruction upon our Hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, When God ≈øhall with-hold in≈øtruction from us, becau≈øe we have refu≈øed it, the time may come, when, as <hi>Am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> 8.12. <hi>Men ≈øhall run to and fro, and ≈øeek the Word of the Lord and ≈øhall not find it;</hi> and then we ≈øhall ≈øee the worth of the Word, that now we prize not.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When God ≈øhall call us to account for all <hi>Sermons,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructions</hi> we have received, as he will certainly do; though we forget, yet he will remember, and he will ask how we have kept, and improved the Word he hath ≈øpoken to us.</p>
            <p>To help us in keeping, or remembring the words of Chri≈øt,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Let our hearts be affected with the worth and excellency of the Word, that it is more precious than Gold or Silver: and then we ≈øhall keep it as choyce Trea≈øure. That which a man prizeth, he will keep in ≈øafe cu≈øtody, and have often in his eyes, as <hi>David</hi> ≈øayes of the Word, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 119.97. <hi>O how I love thy Law, it is my meditation all the day long.</hi> If a man account the Word as his Trea≈øure, he will not forget it, as <hi>Jerem.</hi> 2.32. <hi>Can a Maid forget her Ornaments, or a Bride her Attires?</hi> This they forget not. Yet becau≈øe we account the Word as excellent and nece≈ø≈øary as the≈øe, therefore it follows, <hi>Yet my people have forgotten me dayes without number.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Apply every word of Chri≈øt to your own Soul: though men will not keep what is anothers, yet u≈øually they keep what is their own; while men carve away the Word to others, as if it concern'd not them, it is no marvel if they keep it not: but if we accounted every word as ≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to us, and our portion, we ≈øhould hear and keep it. Men remember the news which concerns them≈øelves. We ≈øhould hear Chri≈øt ≈øpeaking, as <hi>Job</hi> 5.27. <hi>Hear thou this, know it for thy good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Meditate often upon what you have received, as <hi>Mary pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the ≈øayings</hi> which ≈øhe heard, <hi>in her heart.</hi> The way to keep any
<pb facs="tcp:62760:215"/>thing ≈øafe, is to have a con≈øtant eye upon it. Meditation is the Souls ≈øerious retiring into it ≈øelf, to take a view of all that of God that is laid up within it ≈øelf.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Ha≈øten to do all that you have heard and learned, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 119.16. It is ≈øaid by <hi>David, I made ha≈øte, and prolonged not the time to keep his Commandements.</hi> A man will not ea≈øily forget his Trade; for if we daily obey commands, and believe promi≈øes, we cannot ea≈øily forget the commands and promi≈øes given to us: which la≈øt direction leads me to the ≈øecond Exhortation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It may exhort us to keep the words of Chri≈øt with an Evangelical and Practical keeping. Keep the Word as a man keeps his Rule; or the Souldier keeps his Weapon; let not the Word depart from thee, and do not thou depart from it, by for≈øaking the appointments and commands of Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Con≈øider, That if we do not keep the words of Chri≈øt, by obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a ≈øuitable walking, we do but in vain pretend love to Je≈øus Chri≈øt, as they that had no more of Chri≈øt, but to call him Lord, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 7.21.) <hi>Not every one that ≈øaith unto me, Lord, Lord, ≈øhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. So, not every one that ≈øayes he loves me, but he that doth my Word, he is my friend.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Con≈øider, What a ≈øin it is to pretend love to Chri≈øt, and not ≈øo truly to love Him, as to keep his Words; 'tis Hypocri≈øie, they be Chri≈øts fal≈øe friends: an open enemy is le≈øs dangerous than they, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. <hi>They hear my words, but they will not do them, their heart goes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter convetou≈øne≈øs:</hi> They be fal≈øe to them≈øelves, and delude their own ≈øouls with a bare profe≈ø≈øion and hearing, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Be ye doers of the Word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own ≈øouls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Con≈øider, What judgment they incurr, and who can tell how great it is? 'Tis called a beating with many ≈øtripes, when the lea≈øt ≈øtripe from that hand can break the loyns, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.47. <hi>He that knoweth his Ma≈øters will and doth it not, ≈øhall be beaten with many ≈øt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>ipes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Con≈øider, This is the cleare≈øt evidence of our intere≈øt in Chri≈øt, of his love to us, <hi>That we keep his Commandements.</hi> By this we know that we love him as our Chri≈øt, when we do not only love him as a Je≈øus, a Saviour, but obey him as a Lord, and follow his Law. When God ≈øhall write his Law in our hearts, is not this an evidence that Chri≈øt is ours?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Great and many are the encouragements which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øed to them that keep his words. There be many ble≈ø≈øings in the
<pb facs="tcp:62760:216"/>Word, but they only have the ble≈ø≈øings for theirs, who keep his Word, <hi>James</hi> 1.15. <hi>Who≈øo looketh into the perfect Law of Liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the Word, this man ≈øhall be ble≈ø≈øed in his deed;</hi> he ≈øhall ask what ye will and have it, <hi>Job.</hi> 15.7. <hi>If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask what you will, and it ≈øhall be done unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That we may do the words of <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Let it be the aim and intention of our Souls, when we come to hear, to turn hearing into doing. Say as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.6. <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> and <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Acts 10.33. <hi>Now therefore are we all here pre≈øent before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Beg of God to give you ≈øuch a heart, that you may not only ≈øay, as the people in a good humour once to <hi>Mo≈øes, All that thou ≈øhalt ≈øpeak unto us, that will we ob≈øerve and do;</hi> but find your hearts ≈øuch as in <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.29. <hi>O that there were ≈øuch an heart in them that they would fear me, and keep my Commandements always,</hi> &amp;c. it is he by whom the Word is made (as <hi>James</hi> hath it) <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Fir≈øt, If we keep this Word, this Word will keep us.

            <p>Secondly, If we keep his Word, we ≈øhall not want pre≈øent comforts. The pre≈øent gratuities which we have from <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> ≈øhould be enough to encourage us, if there were no future reward, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 19. <hi>Inkeeping them there is great reward.</hi>

            <p>Fir≈øt, How God, the fir≈øt Per≈øon in the Trinity, is ≈øaid to make his abode with them that keep his Word.</p>
            <p>And this will be two wayes ≈øeen.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, It is not here to be under≈øtood of his common or general pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence, as he is the infinite God, and being Omni-pre≈øent, fills Heaven and Earth: for ≈øo he abides with all the works of his hands; yea, ≈øo he is with them that fear him not.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is here properly under≈øtood of Gods abode by way of ≈øpecial pre≈øence, as he is a gracious Father: therefore Je≈øus Chri≈øt doth fir≈øt expre≈øs the Fathers love, and then his abode, as the product and fruit of his love, <hi>My Father will love him, and we will come unto him,</hi> &amp;c. He will come and abide with his, as a <hi>God in Covenant</hi> with them, therefore hath he put it into a promi≈øe, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be their God, and they ≈øhall be my People.</hi>
            </p>

            <p n="1">1. Negatively: It is not to be under≈øtood of a carnal or corporal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of Chri≈øt, (as <hi>Papi≈øts</hi> imagine) as if the fle≈øh of Chri≈øt could be in all places, <hi>whom the Heavens mu≈øt contain till the time of the re≈øtitution of all things:</hi> for ≈øo ≈øayes the Apo≈øtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. acknowledging, <hi>If he had known Chri≈øt after the fle≈øh, yet ≈øo he knows him no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Affirmatively: He makes abode with his people after a ≈øpiritual manner; God the Father makes his abode with his Servants, as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to them; Je≈øus Chri≈øt abides with them, as the Head of his Church,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:217"/>as it is in <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25. <hi>He is the Head of the Church, and the Saviour of his Body.</hi> God abides with us in Chri≈øt, Je≈øus Chri≈øt abides with us by his Spirit.</p>
            <p>A learned Author ≈øhews four wayes of Chri≈øts abode with Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Politice, ut Rex in Regno,</hi> As a King in his Kingdom; and ≈øo he gives Laws, as the only Head and King of his Church; protects them, and orders all their affairs.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>Occonomice, ut pater in Domo,</hi> As a Father in his Hou≈øe, and ≈øo he takes care, and makes provi≈øion for his people, as a Father for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</item>
               <item>3. <hi>Ethice, ut Ratio in Howine,</hi> As Rea≈øon in a Man, which is the light that directs man in all his actions: Je≈øus Chri≈øt directs and leads his people.</item>
               <item>4. <hi>Phy≈øice, ut Anima in Corpore,</hi> As the Soul in the Body, which ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates and acts the whole man, without which the Body is a dead and livele≈øs Trunk; ≈øo Je≈øus Chri≈øt doth quicken our Souls, by whom we have ≈øpiritual life.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And, that he is the Head of the Church, and thus abides with them,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Con≈øider he hath all grace, and life in him: <hi>John</hi> 5.26. <hi>As the Father hath life in him≈øelf, ≈øo hath he given to the Son to have life in him≈øelf;</hi> Therefore the <hi>P≈øalmi≈øt</hi> ≈øayes, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 36.9. <hi>With the is thee Well of life, and in thy light ≈øhall we ≈øee light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, From him is all grace and life conveyed out unto us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Of his fulne≈øs have all we received, and grace for grace.</hi> Yea, what≈øoever we receive from the Spirit of God, we have from him origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, as in <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.15. <hi>For he ≈øhall take of mine and ≈øhew it unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, How God and Chri≈øt are both ≈øaid to make their abode with them that keep his Word. And this I ≈øhall ≈øhew to be, three wayes.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, By their ≈øpecial providence and in≈øpection with them, and ≈øo we may ≈øee them in ≈øeveral Scriptures abiding with them, as in <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.8, 9, 10. ver≈øes. <hi>There's Je≈øus Chri≈øt among the Myrtle trees,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øent the <hi>Church.</hi> And in <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.13. <hi>He is there in the mid≈øt of his golden Candle-≈øticks.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> tells us of his experience of Gods pre≈øence with him, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 73.23. <hi>I am continually with thee, thou upholde≈øt me with thy right hand.</hi> And the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7. <hi>The Lord ≈øtood by me.</hi> Indeed the eyes of the Lord are upon the Righteous, and he hath ≈øaid, he will not leave them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They make their abode with them in the <hi>Go≈øpel,</hi> and <hi>Go≈øpel
<pb facs="tcp:62760:217"/>Ordinances:</hi> where the≈øe be continued in their power and purity, there <hi>the Tabernacle of God is among men;</hi> and when the≈øe are taken away, <hi>Ichabod,</hi> the Glory is departed: We may ≈øay, <hi>God</hi> hath for≈øaken us. As the <hi>Ark</hi> was a type and token of Gods ≈øpecial pre≈øence with the <hi>Jews,</hi> ≈øo the <hi>Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> and <hi>Go≈øpel-Ordinances,</hi> are a ≈øignal token of Gods abode with us; for in the≈øe we may ≈øee him, in the≈øe we may enjoy him, by the≈øe we may be made like to him, as in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 31.18. <hi>But we all with open fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>e behold, as in a Gla≈øs, the glory of God, and are changed into the ≈øame Image, from Glory to Glory, even as h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap> the Spirit of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, They make their abode with them in the Spirit, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Father and the Son; So they may both be ≈øaid truly to abide with us, while we have the Spirit, the Comforter which proceeds from the Father and the Son as a pledge of their love, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.20. <hi>When the Comforter is come, whom I will ≈øend unto you from the Father: I will ≈øend him,</hi> ≈øays Chri≈øt, <hi>even the ≈øpirit of truth, which</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, which proceedeth from the Father: There is an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, a Proce≈ø≈øion of the Holy Gho≈øt, from the Father and the Son to the People that keep his Word; and thus Believers are ≈øaid to hold fellow≈øhip with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, in the fir≈øt <hi>Epi≈øt.</hi> of <hi>John</hi> 23. <hi>It is by the Spirit we are drawn; being drawn we come; being come, we are enabled to walk with God in Chri≈øt:</hi> It is the Spirit that doth for all us. As in the <hi>Eccho,</hi> the Aire being moved by the voyce, returns the ≈øame ≈øound by its own motion: So in all our Communion with God and Chri≈øt; the Soul being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Spirit, returns an≈øwer by vertue of the Spirits motion in us: Come, ≈øays the Spirit; I come ≈øays the Soul, being taught by the ≈øame Spirit.</p>
            <p>All the works wrought on the Souls of men in order to Salvation, are wrought of God and Chri≈øt in us, but by the Spirit; As in the≈øe three ≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial particulars.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, By the Spirit they in≈øtruct and teach; The <hi>Spirit is an enlightening Spirit, a Spirit of Judgment and of Burning.</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> reveals the coun≈øels of God, the great My≈øteries of the Kingdom; leads into all Truth, makes men wi≈øe to Salvation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By this Spirit they quicken and comfort the Souls of men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. It is by the Spirit that <hi>the love of God i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap> ≈øhed abroad in our hourts.</hi> Our cold and frozen ≈øpirits are warmed and made fit for action, and by this Spirit we are awakened: Hence the Church prayes for the breathings of this Spirit, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Awake O North-wind, and come thou South, blow upon my Garden, that the Spices <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>

                     <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                  </gap> flow out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:218"/>Thirdly, By his <hi>Spirit</hi> they do ≈øtrengthen, and e≈øtabli≈øh the hearts of men in the ways of Holine≈øs, thus they are made ≈øtrong in the <hi>Lord,</hi> and in the power of his might: ≈øtrong to re≈øi≈øt temptations; ≈øtrong to ≈øuppre≈øs corruptions; ≈øtrong to perform duties: by this <hi>Spirit</hi> they are carried through all difficulties; by this <hi>Spirit</hi> their infirmities are healed; they are made to per≈øevere, and kept <hi>≈øtedfa≈øt and unmoveable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes abounding in the work of the Lord, and ≈øealed up to the day of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> do make their abode with them that keep the Words of <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> till they come to make an everla≈øting abode with them in Heaven.</p>
            <p>And according to the workings of this <hi>Spirit</hi> more or le≈øs in the hearts of men, God is ≈øaid to be pre≈øent, or ab≈øent from his people.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Rea≈øons why God and Chri≈øt will make their abode with them that keep his words.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Becau≈øe of their ≈øpecial love to, and care of them that keep his words. Indeed all the care of God is concerning his people that he hath in the world: therefore in the ≈øecond Commandement, he is ≈øaid <hi>to ≈øhew mercy to thou≈øands of them that fear him, and keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> that do not <hi>ca≈øt his words behind their backs,</hi> and for≈øaking his Appointments, <hi>follow their own Inventions:</hi> So that if we faithfully keep his Word, he will abide with us in our work: And this is the great Rea≈øon in the Text, <hi>My Father will love him;</hi> not but that he loves his Elect from Eternity, but he will manife≈øt his Love to them, and therefore <hi>he will make his abode with them,</hi> as the people of his Love; for in <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.9. <hi>The Lords Portion is his People, and Jacob is the Lot of his Inheritance.</hi> And in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17. they are called <hi>his Jewels,</hi> and <hi>men will abide with their Trea≈øure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Becau≈øe of the near Relation that is between God and Chri≈øt, and them that keep his Word. That is a very full place of Scripture for this purpo≈øe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.50. <hi>Who≈øoever ≈øhall do the will of my Father which is in Heaven, the ≈øame is my Brother, and Si≈øter, and Mother.</hi> What nearer Relation can there be than the≈øe? So near are they to Je≈øus Chri≈øt, that keep his Word, ob≈øerve his Will, and be true and faithful to his Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and ≈øure, ≈øuch near Relations will de≈øire Cohabitations on both ≈øides.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, God and Chri≈øt are ≈øaid to ≈øtand Related in a <hi>Paternal Relation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, They are ≈øaid to ≈øtand Related in a <hi>Conjugal Relation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, God and Chri≈øt ≈øtand in a Paternal Relation to his People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:218"/>Fir≈øt, <hi>God</hi> is their <hi>Father,</hi> and they are his <hi>Sons</hi> and <hi>Daughters;</hi> And this the <hi>Church</hi> doth acknowledge in <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 63.16. <hi>Doubtle≈øs thou art our Father, though</hi> Abraham <hi>be ignorant of us, and</hi> I≈ørael <hi>acknowledge us not, thou O Lord art our Father,</hi> &amp;c. And with this the Lord comforted mourning Zion, <hi>I≈øai.</hi> 49.14, 15. <hi>But</hi> Zion <hi>≈øaid, The Lord hath for≈øaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me:</hi> But <hi>God</hi> ≈øays, <hi>Can a Woman forget her ≈øucking child, that ≈øhe ≈øhould not have compa≈ø≈øion on the Sons of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet I will not forget thee: Behold, I have graven thee on the palms of my hands,</hi> &amp;c. My abode is with thee.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt</hi> is their <hi>Father, I≈øai.</hi> 9.6. <hi>The everla≈øting Father.</hi> Therefore he promi≈øeth his Di≈øciples in this 14 <hi>John</hi> 18. <hi>I will not leave you</hi>

            <p>Secondly, <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> ≈øtand related to them that keep his Word in a <hi>Conjugal relation;</hi> and <hi>God</hi> hath laid a ≈øpecial command of co-habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon per≈øons in this relation, <hi>The man mu≈øt dwell with his own Wife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, <hi>God</hi> is related as a <hi>Husband,</hi> And will not God dwell with his People, when he hath e≈øpou≈øed to him≈øelf? <hi>I will betrothed thee unto me for ever</hi> (Ho≈øea 2.19.) <hi>Yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteou≈øne≈øs and judgment, and in loving kindne≈øs, and in mercies; I have even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth thee unto me in faithfulne≈øs.</hi> And in <hi>I≈øai.</hi> 54.5, 6. <hi>For thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker is thy Husband,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For the Lord hath called thee, as a Woman for≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt</hi> is the <hi>Husband</hi> of his People, as we ≈øee in the whole Book of <hi>Canticles.</hi> And ≈øo in <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 5. from the 29.

Doth <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt</hi> delight to lodge any where more than with the <hi>Wife</hi> of the bo≈øome?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becau≈øe of <hi>Gods</hi> faithful Covenant, he will make his abode with them that keep his Word.

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What a ≈øpecial ble≈ø≈øing it is, to a per≈øon or people, to have <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> to make their abode with them.</p>
            <p>The excellency and de≈øireablene≈øs of this abode of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> with Believers, may be ≈øeen in the≈øe three partioulars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> It is better than all outward mercies, and earthly ble≈ø≈øings.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This will more than ≈øupply the want or ab≈øence of all other comforts.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> All our happine≈øs doth lye in this, <hi>Gods pre≈øence with us.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> The abode of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> with a ≈øoul, is better than all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mercies, or earthly ble≈ø≈øings what≈øoever. <hi>God</hi> was wont to tell his people heretofore, as in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. <hi>That if they would keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, they ≈øhall be ble≈ø≈øed in their basket, and in their ≈øtore; that he would give them peace, the fat heritage of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and to ride upon the high places;</hi> all goodly mercies: But now he doth encourage them by a ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing of far greater worth, <hi>I will love you, I will make my abode with you.</hi> It is ≈øo high and tran≈øcendent a favour, that <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> preferred it before the goodly Land of Promi≈øe, <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land flowing with milk and honey, as appears by that pa≈ø≈øage in <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.15. <hi>If thy pre≈øence goe not

A wilderne≈øs condition with <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Tent,</hi> is better than all plea≈øures and honours without God in the Palace. Hence <hi>David</hi> in the mid≈øt of all his royal pomp and greatne≈øs, de≈øired this, as the complement and perfection of all, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 101.1, 2. <hi>O when wilt thou come unto me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Con≈øider the≈øe two Particulars:</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> That there is no beauty nor de≈øireablene≈øs in the faire≈øt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pro≈øperity, if <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> do not make their abode with us. If we have all the World, and cannot ≈øee the abode of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> on our Tabernacle, in their ≈øpecial Providence, in Soul-refre≈øhing Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, or by the comforting Spirit; We may look on all, and ≈øay as <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi> did of the Cities <hi>Solomon</hi> gave him, they be <hi>Cabul, Dirty things.</hi> If we cannot find <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> thus with us, in the mid≈øt of our glory, <hi>The glory is departed.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Con≈øider, There is no mi≈øery, nor unhappine≈øs in the wor≈øt afflictions, if <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> be there; in the <hi>Furnace</hi> there is no <hi>Death,</hi> in <hi>Captivity</hi> no <hi>Darkne≈øs,</hi> in <hi>Pri≈øon</hi> no <hi>Sadne≈øs,</hi> in <hi>Death</hi> no <hi>Hell. Je≈øus Chri≈øt</hi> tells us, <hi>he will not leave us comfortle≈øs;</hi> He never told us, we ≈øhould not meet with tribulations, but ≈øayes, <hi>In the world we ≈øhall have tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> and as ≈øurely, <hi>That in him we ≈øhall have con≈øolation.</hi> His people may be in the World friendle≈øs, harbourle≈øs, pennyle≈øs, but he a≈ø≈øures them, they ≈øhall never be comfortle≈øs.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Again: This abode of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> with his people, will more than ≈øupply the want or ab≈øence of all other things. <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi> when he would throughly encourage his Di≈øciples again≈øt all the hard≈øhips, and di≈øcouraging fears they might meet withal after his departure, gives them this one precious <hi>Cordial</hi> or <hi>Catholicon,</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the World: When you are ca≈øt out of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, had before Magi≈øtrates and Rulers for my Names ≈øake, ≈øcourged, hated, impri≈øoned: for all the≈øe things ≈øhall they do unto you; let this comfort you; Lu, I am with you alway, to the end of the world,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed: This abode of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> with his people, is every thing to the Soul; which we may ≈øee in the≈øe three particulars:</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> Their Pre≈øence is <hi>a Sanctuary, and ≈øure Hiding-place.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is <hi>a ≈øure Light and Guide to them.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is <hi>a Store-hou≈øe and Trea≈øure of all Provi≈øions.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> The abode or pre≈øence of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> is in ≈øtead of a <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, or ≈øure Hiding place;</hi> as <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 84.11. <hi>For the Lord God is a Sun
<pb facs="tcp:62760:220"/>and Shield, &amp;c.</hi> and in <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 8.13. ≈øays the Prophet, <hi>Sanctifie the Lord God of He≈øts, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread, and he ≈øhall be for a Sanctuary:</hi> Do you ≈øet <hi>God</hi> before you, and he will ≈øet him≈øelf by you; and where the great <hi>God goes,</hi> there <hi>goes a Guard of Angels.</hi> P≈øal. 34.7. <hi>His wings be a Covert, and his hand a Canopy, with which he hides from the Storm, and from Rain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that he is a mighty Saviour;</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Con≈øider his <hi>Omnipotency;</hi> He can do whatever plea≈øeth him; He can make the <hi>worm</hi> Jacob <hi>to thre≈øh Mountains, and the Mountains to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a plain before</hi> Zerubbabel, Zach. 4.7. <hi>All the Nations of the Earth are but as the drop of the Bucket, or du≈øt of the Balance, compared with him; and all hearts are in his hands.</hi> Therefore, ≈øays the Prophet, in <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 26.4. <hi>Tru≈øt in the Lord for ever, for in the Lord</hi> Jehovah <hi>is everla≈øting ≈øtrength, or, the</hi> Rock <hi>of ages.</hi> He is no broken Reed, but that ≈øtrength in which we may confide: As <hi>David</hi> ≈øays, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 46.1, 2, 3. Si fractus illabatur Orbis, <hi>If the world be di≈ø≈øolved, God is our refuge and ≈øtrength,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>therefore we will not fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the mid≈øt of the Sea,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Con≈øider his <hi>Immutability;</hi> We have ≈øtanding comfort in the unchangeablene≈øs of this God, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.6. <hi>I am the Lord, I change not, therefore ye ≈øons of</hi> Jacob <hi>are not con≈øumed.</hi> And for this we have the experience of <hi>David,</hi> P≈øal. 9.10. <hi>They that know thy Name, will put their tru≈øt in thee, for thou</hi> (Lord) <hi>ha≈øt not for≈øaken them that ≈øeek thee:</hi> and the Churches experience, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 63.9. <hi>He bears them, and he carried them all the days of old.</hi> This great unchangeable <hi>Saviour</hi> ≈øaves his people the≈øe four ways.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, He will ≈øave and pre≈øerve them from evils, and will be a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ≈øafety, when the indignation is abroad, to hide from the ≈øtorm; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Yet will I be to them as a little Sanctuary in the countries where they ≈øhall come. I will be with thee,</hi> is God's great Promi≈øe, and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's Security; it was <hi>Jo≈øhua</hi>'s Guard, and <hi>Jeremab</hi>'s Brazen-Wall.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He will ≈øave his people in afflictions, as he did the three Children in the burning Furnace. Thus he delivers <hi>in ≈øix troubles, and al≈øo in ≈øeven,</hi> as 'tis promi≈øed in <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 43.2, 3. <hi>When thou pa≈ø≈øe≈øt through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the Rivers, they ≈øhall not overflow thee. When thou walke≈øt through the fire, thou ≈øhalt not be burnt, neither ≈øhall the flame kindle upon thee; for I am the Lord thy God, the holy One of I≈ørael, thy Saviour. Job</hi>'s experience is an everla≈øting proof of this, that when the Lead is con≈øumed, the Gold is pre≈øerved in the Furnace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:220"/>Thirdly, He will ≈øave or deliver out of afflictions, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>In the mid≈øt of all temptations, he will make away for us to e≈øcape them. Many are the troubles of the Righteous, but the Lord delivereth them out of all.</hi> He is <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> God with us; Our Redeemer from Hell, and from trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He will ≈øave by afflictions, and by the evils they meet withal. <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.15. <hi>The Rod and Reproof give wi≈ødom;</hi> and, as <hi>David</hi> ≈øays, <hi>It was good for me that I was afflicted.</hi> All things ≈øhall work for good. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>The≈øe afflictions work for us a for more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory.</hi> The Ve≈ø≈øel is u≈øually covered with dirt, by the clean≈øer's hand, that it may ≈øhine with the more brightne≈øs; So, by afflictions, God makes us par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his Holine≈øs.</p>
            <p>Afflictions and outward evils come alike to all, but with much different effect; All men fall into afflictions, Good and Bad: but as the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> went both into the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> and the one was drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the other pa≈ø≈øed through to <hi>Canaan;</hi> ≈øo the Righteous and the Wicked fall under Calamity, the one finks through unbelief, and the other pa≈ø≈øes through ≈øafely, <hi>And by Faith and patience comes to inherit the Promi≈øe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The Abode or Pre≈øence of God and Chri≈øt with Believers, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> in≈øtead of a ≈øure Guide and Light unto them; They can never want a Guide, who have God with them. As the Pillar of a Cloud by day, and of Fire by night, was unto <hi>I≈ørael</hi> in all their March, the ≈øame and more is God to his People in all their Pilgrimage.</p>
            <p>Con≈øider three things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Fir≈øt, Con≈øider, That Man cannot be without this Guide; The be≈øt of man have very great need of the pre≈øence of God to lead them, that they be not me≈ø-led, and that they don't ≈øaint in the way; <hi>What can the Sheep do without a Shepherd?</hi> Such is God to his, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 23.1. Without God<hi>'s</hi> abode with us, it is as Children without a Father, and none to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them, and ≈øo left to run them≈øelves into mi≈øchief. What is the World without a Sun? <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.23. <hi>The way of man is not in him≈øelf, it is not in man that walketh to direct his ≈øteps.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Secondly, Con≈øider, That it is our great wi≈ødom to commit our way to the guidance of this God and Chri≈øt; Every wi≈øe man will commit his way to God; and not move a ≈øtep without him; as <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> in the Conduct of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> would not move a foot without God. That was a good Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or rather Re≈øolution of <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 73.24. <hi>That ≈øhalt guide me with thy Coun≈øel, and afterwards receive me into Glory;</hi> I am re≈øolved be guided by <hi>Gods Coun≈øels:</hi> and an excellent and imitable practice of <hi>I≈øaac</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:62760:221"/>in <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.24, 25. that where he had met <hi>God</hi> at <hi>Beer-≈øheba,</hi> and where <hi>God</hi> had ble≈ø≈øed him, there he pitched his Tent; ≈øo we ≈øhould move as <hi>God</hi> leads.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, Con≈øider, That if God undertakes to guide us we ≈øhall not mi≈øcarry, he will certainly bring us ≈øafe to Heaven. Our feet may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt gone, but ≈øhall not be altogether gone. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 73.2. <hi>My feet were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt gone, my ≈øteps had well-nigh ≈ølipt.</hi> So it may be with the choice≈øt of <hi>Gods</hi> Servants; but in the 23. ver≈øe, <hi>Neverthele≈øs, I am continually with thee; thou ha≈øt holden me by my right hand.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>The more dark and dangerous the times be, the more we ≈øhould de≈øire <hi>Gods</hi> abode with us; the nearer a night of trouble or of death is to us, the more earne≈øtly beg his ≈øtay, as the two Di≈øciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.29. They con≈øtrained Chri≈øt, ≈øaying, <hi>Abide with us, for it is towards evening, and the day is far ≈øpent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The abode or pre≈øence of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> with his people, is in ≈øtead of a Trea≈øury and Store-hou≈øe of all Provi≈øions. Where <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt</hi> is, and where <hi>God</hi> makes his abode, there is a Spring-head of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts that cannot be drawn dry, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 33.16. <hi>Bread ≈øhall be given them, and their waters ≈øhall be ≈øure, who have God with them.</hi> So was <hi>God</hi> to <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> Deut. 29.5, 6. <hi>He fed I≈ørael in the wilderne≈øs forty years, their cloaths did not wax old. You have not eaten bread, neither have you drunk wine, or ≈øtrong drink, that ye might know that I am the Lord your God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Con≈øider three Particulars here.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Fir≈øt, Con≈øider, <hi>God is ≈øuch a ≈øtore,</hi> that he is alwayes full; He hath an <hi>Autarchy</hi> in him≈øelf, and ≈øays to his creatures, as in <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 81.10. <hi>Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it; Ask what you will, and there it is to be had.</hi> There be full trea≈øures of temporal and ≈øpiritual good things with them, with whom <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> do make their abode. As the Ark of <hi>God</hi> brought all kind of ble≈ø≈øings to the hou≈øe of <hi>Obed-Edom,</hi> ≈øo when <hi>God</hi> comes, he brings all things; <hi>Deus meus &amp; omnid;</hi> My <hi>God,</hi> and all things. When <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt</hi> came to <hi>Zacheus,</hi> he tells him, <hi>This day is ≈øalvation come to thine Hou≈øe;</hi> that is, both temporal and ≈øpiritual pre≈øervations and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances; Salvation doth con≈øi≈øt in the total ab≈øence of all evil, and in the pre≈øence and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of all good.</item>
               <item>Secondly, <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> have left with us the promi≈øes of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to live upon, till we come to the inheritance of the purcha≈øed Po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øion: The≈øe be like the <hi>Widows Cru≈øe,</hi> that never fails; this, like the <hi>Manna,</hi> will not be with-held while we be in the Wilderne≈øs, till we come into <hi>Canaan,</hi> to feed on the fruits of that Land, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. That is a ≈øure Promi≈øe, in which we may by faith ≈øee pre≈øent ≈øupplies, <hi>I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb facs="tcp:62760:221"/>leave thee, nor for≈øake thee;</hi> and in <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.19. (We may po≈ø≈øe≈øs in that Promi≈øe whatever we want) <hi>My God ≈øhall ≈øupply all your need, according to his riches in glory, by Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Thirdly, God hath given us his Son, and <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt</hi> hath given us him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, as an en≈øuring pledge of all mercies contained in the promi≈øes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. <hi>He that ≈øpared not his own Son, but gave him for us, how ≈øhall be not with him freely give us all things?</hi> He that hath not ≈øpared his Son, will not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold any mercies; He that hath given us the be≈øt of ble≈ø≈øings, will not with-hold ≈ømaller mercies; He doth always tell his people, as in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. <hi>My grace is ≈øufficient for you.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Thirdly, The abode of God and Chri≈øt with Believers, is their Heaven upon Earth. All our happine≈øs is in the abode of God and Chri≈øt with us.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Con≈øider it is a wonderful mercy of the great God, that by his common Providence, he is with the works of his hands, which is mans ≈øafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and <hi>David</hi> admires at this, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 8.4. <hi>Lord, what is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the ≈øon of man, that thou vi≈øite≈øt him?</hi>

            <p>Secondly, Con≈øider it is a mercy, of the greate≈øt worth, and to be for ever admired, that <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> do not only vi≈øit us by common Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and In≈øpection, as his creatures, but make their abode with us, as with children and friends. O this is our glory; God doth not come with a ≈øhort life, for a day, for a few dayes, <hi>but makes an everla≈øting abode.</hi> The Church complained when ≈øhe thought God was departed, becau≈øe he had been with them, and made ≈øo ≈øhort a ≈øtay, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.8. <hi>Way ≈øhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt thou be as a ≈øtranger in the Land, and as a wayfaring man that turneth a≈øide to tarry for a night?</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>Fir≈øt, Con≈øider Je≈øus Chri≈øt hath promi≈øed this as our great glory, and full reward; <hi>I will take you to my ≈øelf, they ≈øhall behold my glory,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.3. <hi>We ≈øhall be like him, we ≈øhall ≈øee him, as he is.</hi>

            <p>Thirdly, We may finde them in Prayer, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you:</hi> If you will be ≈øtrangers to the duty of Prayer, to the Throne of Grace, God will be a ≈øtranger to you; he hath promi≈øed to draw nigh to them that draw nigh to him: and ≈øo in <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.24. <hi>In all places where I record my name, I will come unto thee, and I will ble≈øs thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, We may finde them in the communion with the people of God: <hi>Where two or three are niet together in my name, there will I be</hi> (≈øays Chri≈øt) <hi>in the mid≈øt of them.</hi> Therefore Je≈øus Chri≈øt directs us to go up by the ≈øoot-≈øteps of the flock, and they enquire wi≈øely, <hi>Cam.</hi> 6.1. that ≈øay to the Church of Chri≈øt, <hi>Whither is thy beloved gone, that we may ≈øeek him with thee?</hi> And when the two Di≈øciples went to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Chri≈øt, he came and joyned him≈øelf with them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, How, or after what manner we mu≈øt ≈øeek God and Chri≈øt?</p>
            <p>Take the≈øe four following Directions:</p>
            <list>
               <item>Fir≈øt, Affect your ≈øelves with the worth and excellency of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of God and Chri≈øt, carry a high e≈øteem of them in your hearts: think with your ≈øelves how ≈øafely they are immured, as the Prophet ≈øaid unto his ≈øervant, <hi>There is more for them, than can be again≈øt them:</hi> I≈øa. 33.16. <hi>Their place of defence is the munition of r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

O what ≈øweetne≈ø≈øe and ≈øatisfaction have they within, with whom: God and Chri≈øt abides! as the Spou≈øe doth expre≈øs it, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Becau≈øe of the ≈øavour of thy Oyntments, thy Name is as Oyntments p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

O ≈øweetne≈øs and ≈øatisfaction beyond expre≈ø≈øion! and then conclude, <hi>Si tanius quaerentibus, O quantus p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>≈ø≈øidentibus!</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:62760:225"/>If he be ≈øo good to them that ≈øeek him, how good is he to them that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him!</item>
               <item>Secondly, Labour to affect your ≈øouls with the great want and need that you have of the pre≈øence of God and Chri≈øt, while men do think in their hearts they can be well enough without God and Chri≈øt, they will never ≈øeek after them, but ≈øay, as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.31. <hi>We are Lords, we will come no more unto thee;</hi> that is, we have ≈øtrength enough of our own, we need no more of thy ≈øupport: and thus <hi>David</hi> brings in the wicked, priding them≈øelves, in <hi>P≈øa.</hi> 10.4. <hi>The wicked through the pride of his countenance,</hi> (as in the Original, <hi>through the pride of his no≈øe</hi>) <hi>will not ≈øeek after God.</hi> God is not in all his thoughts: when the≈øe proud <hi>Laodicean</hi> ≈øpirits will not ≈øeek, the poor, hungry, de≈øolate ≈øoul, that ≈øees a need of God and Chri≈øt, finde them.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, Quicken your ≈øelves to much diligence in ≈øeeking. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet complains, <hi>No man ≈øtirreth up him≈øelf to ≈øeek the Lord.</hi> It is a bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of the greate≈øt concernment, and mu≈øt not be attended with a cold indifferency, but as one ≈øet on by a true love, and where that is, <hi>Non qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øcit amor, ≈øed quaerit amatum;</hi> Love will be re≈øtle≈øs in the pur≈øuit of the thing, or per≈øon beloved. See with what heat men ≈øeek the world, with much more heat ≈øeek God and Chri≈øt. We mu≈øt do as the woman that had lo≈øt her groat, ≈øhe lights a candle, ≈øweeps the hou≈øe, ≈øeeks diligently; ≈øo we mu≈øt ≈øet up the light of the Word, and to work with the be≈øom of a ≈øerious repentance, and thorow-reformation, and diligently enquire. Thus <hi>David</hi> with a very vigilant eye, ≈øeeks him whom his ≈øoul loved, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 132.4, 5. <hi>I will not give re≈øt to mine eyes, nor ≈ølumber to my eye-lids, till I have found out a place for God,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
               <item>La≈øtly, Re≈øolve with your ≈øelves never to give over, till you come to the perfect and full enjoyment of them, as <hi>Job</hi> ≈øaid, <hi>I will wait all the days of my appointed time:</hi> ≈øo do you ≈øeek all the days of your appointed time; if we would finde God and Chri≈øt, we mu≈øt all ≈øeek the days of our lives. They that will finde what they ≈øeek, mu≈øt ≈øeek till they finde. As God in the Creation did not re≈øt till he had man, ≈øo man ≈øhould not re≈øt till he hath found God; and as in the Redemption Je≈øus Chri≈øt did never cea≈øe ≈øeeking, till he found all the <hi>lo≈øt ≈øheep of the hou≈øe of I≈ørael;</hi> ≈øo we ≈øhould never give over, till we have made God and Chri≈øt our own.</item>
            </list>
            <p>This ≈øhould be the work of our lives, and upon this work I mu≈øt leave you.</p>
            <q>
               <p>For now I mu≈øt tell you, that (perhaps) you may not ≈øee my face,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:225"/>or hear my voice any more in this place; yet not out of any peevi≈øh humor, or di≈øaffection to the pre≈øent Authority of the Kingdom (I call God and Man to witne≈øs this day) it being my own practice and Coun≈øel to you all, <hi>to fear GOD and Honour the KING;</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a real di≈ø≈øatisfaction in ≈øome particulars impo≈øed, to which (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding all endeavors to that purpo≈øe) my con≈øcience cannot yet be e≈øpou≈øed; Wherefore, I hope in this, and in all my abode with you, I may ≈øay (without o≈øtentation) with the Apo≈øtle in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Our rejoycing is this, The te≈øtimony of a good Con≈øcience, that in ≈øimplicity and godly ≈øincerity, we have had our conver≈øation in the World, e≈øpecially to you<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</hi> And as he ≈øaith in <hi>Acts</hi> 20.26, 27. So, <hi>I take you to record this day, that I have endeavoured to be pure from the bloud of all men; for I have not ≈øhunned to declare unto you the whole coun≈øel of God,</hi> both by my life and Doctrine; becau≈øe I knew this very well, that (as one ≈øays) <hi>Suadet loquentis vita, non oratio;</hi> that the Preachers life, is the mo≈øt lively Preaching.</p>
               <p>I ≈øhall onely add this (my Friends) that though my Lips be ≈øealed up that I may not ≈øpeak from God to you, yet I ≈øhall not cea≈øe to ≈øpeak to God for you, as ever I have done: And though I cannot have you in my eye, yet I ≈øhall lodge you in my heart; and asking nothing of you, but your Prayers, ≈øhall hope to meet you daily at the <hi>Throne</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> and that at la≈øt we may enjoy one another in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And becau≈øe they ≈øay, <hi>the words of a dying man makes the deepe≈øt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion,</hi> before I am altogether civilly dead, <hi>I</hi> ≈øhall give you one Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation more.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Secondly, Let it be your endeavour to keep God and Chri≈øt with you, that they may make their abode with you in their hearts and hou≈øes, <hi>that what≈øoever you loo≈øe, you may not be undone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the General.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Fir≈øt, <hi>Take heed you do not ≈ølight, or abu≈øe his Providences.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Secondly, <hi>Do not de≈øpi≈øe or neglect his Ordinances.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Thirdly, <hi>Be ≈øure you do not grieve his ≈øpirit.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Ob≈øerve more particularly the≈øe ten Directions, which I would leave with you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That God and Chri≈øt may make their con≈øtant abode with you;</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, <hi>Endeavour to plea≈øe God and Chri≈øt, and to walk as the Go≈øpel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi> in all well-plea≈øing. <hi>And for this purpo≈øe, Ob≈øerve the≈øe three Rules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Entertain God and Chri≈øt like them≈øelves. Now they are come
<pb facs="tcp:62760:226"/>to you as <hi>Solomon</hi> did his <hi>Temple,</hi> which he had prepared for God; <hi>The Heaven of Heavens cannot contain thee, much le≈øs this poor Tent;</hi> ≈øo with the mo≈øt humble frame of ≈øpirit, <hi>admire his greatne≈øs, and infinite conde≈øcen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for he is the King of Glory,</hi> as in <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 24. And ≈øo give him ≈øuitable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, for <hi>he will dwell with the humble and contrite ≈øpirit,</hi> If <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> wondred at the vi≈øit which <hi>Mary</hi> gave her, with a <hi>Whence is it that the Mother of my Lord is come unto me?</hi> then admire that the Lord him≈øelf ≈øhould come, not only to vi≈øit your hearts, but <hi>to make ≈øuch a gracious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode with you.</hi> And, as the Centurion ≈øaid unto Chri≈øt in the Go≈øpel, <hi>I am not worthy thou ≈øhoulde≈øt come under my roof.</hi> So acknowledge your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthine≈øs of ≈øo rich and unparallel'd a grace, that God and Chri≈øt ≈øhould come in unto you, to abide with you.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Wait upon God and Chri≈øt with all readine≈øs of minde, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve every intimation of the will of God to you.</hi> Stand always ready as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants wait upon the hand of their Ma≈øters, ≈øaying in your hearts, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? or, what wilt thou have me to ≈øuffer?</hi> It is the frame and po≈øture which Chri≈øt commends unto his Di≈øciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.35. <hi>Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning, to do his will, as it is done in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Take plea≈øure and delight in the company and ≈øociety of God and Chri≈øt above all the plea≈øures in the world.</hi> Do nothing without fir≈øt calling God and Chri≈øt into the action. Remember this in the≈øe four ca≈øes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpecially.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, <hi>Pray God and Chri≈øt along with you into all your ≈øpiritual duties,</hi> that you may be ≈øure to perform them all according to the mind of God. None knows better what will plea≈øe God than him≈øelf; do not enquire ≈øo much what others ≈øay, but what God appoints; 'tis not what this or that man ≈øays, how we mu≈øt ≈øerve God, but what God ≈øays him≈øelf; as <hi>Augu≈øtin</hi> ≈øaid to the <hi>Manichee</hi> in another ca≈øe, <hi>Nec egote, nec tu me, ≈øed ambo audiamus Apo≈øtolum:</hi> So, hear what God and Chri≈øt ≈øays to us, <hi>as to the performance of all our duties:</hi> If we will entertain God and Chri≈øt, and have their company, we mu≈øt ≈øet before them ≈øuch ≈øavory meat as they like, le≈øt we be like them (<hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9.) of whom Chri≈øt ≈øays, <hi>In vain do they wor≈øhip me,</hi> &amp;c. and our ≈øervice be like theirs, of which the Lord ≈øaid, <hi>Who hath required the≈øe things at your hands?</hi> O what was that great evil the people were guilty of, for which there comes that heavy judgment, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 78.60. <hi>He for≈øook the Tabernacle of</hi> Shiloh, <hi>the Tent which he placed among them.</hi> Sure it was ≈øome great guilt; in the former ver. we find it to be their Hypocri≈øie, Apo≈øtacy, and Idolatry; any taint of
<pb facs="tcp:62760:226"/>this kinde, will make the jealous God for≈øake our ≈øolemn meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Pray God and Chri≈øt into all your Civil affairs.</hi> The Greeks <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>with God</hi> in their entrance upon every work, was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable practi≈øe. It is reported of <hi>Publius Scipio</hi> the <hi>Roman,</hi> that he would always go fir≈øt to the Capitol, and then to the Senate; ≈øo we ≈øhould begin our Civil employments with ≈øpiritual duties: And do as <hi>Abrahams</hi> ≈øervant, when he was to take a Wife for his Ma≈øter's Son, he took God along with him; and thus to abide with God, is to have God to abide with us. Therefore ≈øays the Apo≈øtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.20. <hi>Let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man abide in the ≈øame calling wherein he is called,</hi> and in the 24. Ver≈øe, <hi>Brethren, let every man wherein he is called therein abide with God,</hi> and God will abide with him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Pray God and Chri≈øt to your Tables at your eating and drinking, for man doth not live by Bread only. If the≈øe be gue≈øts at your Tables, you mu≈øt needs have chear enough; there's more ≈øweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs in a mor≈øel with them, than in all dainties without them, and then you may be ≈øure al≈øo your Tables ≈øhall not be a ≈ønare unto you. <hi>Theophra≈øtus</hi> reports of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> that they did fir≈øt <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, and then <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>, they did fir≈øt <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and then <hi>Kill,</hi> lay on their meat, entertain and eat. And it is the Apo≈øtles rule, ≈øeeing all things come of God through Chri≈øt, That God and Chri≈øt ≈øhould not be unbidden gue≈øts: but, as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Whether ye eat or drink, or what≈øoever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Pray God and Chri≈øt along with you in the morning when you ri≈øe, and at evening when you lye down: vi≈øit him morning by morning, and evening by evening; this is the way to have a pro≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous day, and a ≈øafe night: <hi>David</hi> took this cour≈øe, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 4.8. <hi>I will both lay me down, and take my re≈øt, for thou Lord onely make≈øt me dwell in ≈øafety;</hi> and this gave <hi>Jacob</hi> ≈øuch a plea≈øant dream, <hi>Gene≈øis</hi> 28. that having God with him, he was all night within view of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Love God and Chri≈øt above all, and then God and Chri≈øt will not depart from you; for, <hi>He ≈øhews mercy to thou≈øands of them that love him,</hi> and hath made over him≈øelf, and heaven, and all, to them that love him. It is reported of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that his love was ≈øuch to God and Chri≈øt, that he had the name of Chri≈øt, <hi>Cordi ejus in≈øculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> graven upon his Heart. It is ≈øuch a Heart love that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires;
<pb facs="tcp:62760:227"/>for he is a jealous God, and will have all our love.</p>
            <p>If we love any thing better;</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, It will ≈øteal away our hearts from God: And</p>
            <p>Secondly, It will take off the heart of God from us, ≈øo that God and Chri≈øt will ≈øet them≈øelves again≈øt us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If we would have God and Chri≈øt to make their con≈øtant abode with us, delight we in the ≈øociety and fellow≈øhip of the People of God, with whom they dwell; never be a≈øhamed to conver≈øe with them, whom God and Chri≈øt do own for theirs. The Apo≈øtle's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument why we ≈øhould entertain ≈øtrangers, in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.2. <hi>(Becau≈øe thereby ≈øome have entertained Angels unawares)</hi> is but mean and incon≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable to this rea≈øon, why we ≈øhould entertain and own the Saints of God: for thereby we are ≈øure, to entertain Chri≈øt, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.40. For this cau≈øe the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> made a League with I≈ørael, <hi>For we have heard that God is with you.</hi> And there is a promi≈øe in <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.23. That <hi>ten men out of all Languages ≈øhall take hold of the skirt of a Jew, ≈øaying, We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.</hi> Malachy 3.16. <hi>They that feared the Lord ≈øpake often one to another, and the Lord hearkned and heard it,</hi> &amp;c. He was with them, and indeed, God dwells in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles of the righteous.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If we would have the con≈øtant abode of God and Chri≈øt with us, let us keep our ≈øelves clean from ≈øin, our hearts pure, our con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences undefiled, and, as the Apo≈øtle ≈øays, <hi>void of offence towards God and towards men;</hi> very careful not to ≈øin again≈øt God, and very circum≈øpect not to ≈øin again≈øt man; that this may be our comfort, that the world mu≈øt needs ≈øay of us, as they did of <hi>Daniel,</hi> That <hi>they could finde nothing again≈øt him, ≈øave in the Law of his God,</hi> as in <hi>Daniel</hi> 6.5. Whatever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do, beware of ≈øin. Say as <hi>Jo≈øhua, I and my Hou≈øe will ≈øerve the Lord.</hi> Watch again≈øt ≈øin, chu≈øe any ≈øuffering, rather than the lea≈øt finne.</p>
            <p>Con≈øider in that choice two particulars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Fir≈øt, Con≈øider in all your ≈øufferings, God will be with you, but in any of your ≈øins, he will not abide with you; as in the example of <hi>I≈ørael, Exod.</hi> 32.23. <hi>When the Calf was got into the Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

That was an excellent ≈øaying of <hi>Azariah</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Obed,</hi> in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2. And oh that all <hi>England</hi> could hear i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Hear thou me</hi> A≈øa, <hi>and all</hi> Judah, <hi>The Lord is with you, while you be
<pb facs="tcp:62760:227"/>with him; If you ≈øeek him, he will be found of you; but if ye for≈øake him, he will for≈øake you.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Secondly, Con≈øider, 'tis an act of high pre≈øumption, reflecting much upon the purity and holine≈øs of God, for men to imagine that God will own and pro≈øper them with his pre≈øence while they go on to do wickedly, in their Whoredoms, Drunkenne≈øs, Bla≈øphemy, and all manner of Prophanene≈øs, which God can no more own, than di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own him≈øelf. So they fooli≈øhly promi≈øe them≈øelves Peace, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19. <hi>Though they walk in the imagination of their hearts, and adde drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenne≈øs to thir≈øt:</hi> But the Lord will not ≈øpare, but his anger and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou≈øie ≈øhall ≈ømoak again≈øt them, till he hath brought them down from their high mount of a ≈øinful and carnal confidence. Therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet reproves that wicked People, <hi>Micah</hi> 3.11. where the Judges, the Prie≈øts, and the Prophets were corrupted. Yet they ≈øay, <hi>Is not the Lord among us, none evil can come upon us, Therefore ≈øhall</hi> Zion <hi>be plowed as a Field,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>Abner</hi> ≈øaid to <hi>Joab, This will prove an evil thing and a bitter in the latter end:</hi> as <hi>Galen</hi> ≈øays of Meats, <hi>Quae dulcia ≈øunt, facile in bilem &amp; amaritudinem convertuntur;</hi> Sweet Meats generate choller and corrupt matter; ≈øo ≈øin, that is a ≈øweet mor≈øel now, will be ≈øhame, death, and hell at la≈øt.</item>

            <p>Fifthly, With an humble acknowledgment of former barrenne≈øs, under Gods gracious pre≈øence with you, re≈øolve and endeavour to be more fruitful. God never left his Vineyard, and pull'd up the Hedge, and commanded the rain not to fall upon it, in <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 5. <hi>till it became bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, or did bear corrupt fruit.</hi> The exil'd Confe≈ø≈øors in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days, confe≈ø≈øed that (as <hi>

And a ≈øad example of this is <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru≈øalem,</hi> over whom Chri≈øt laments: <hi>O Jeru≈øalem Jeru≈øalem, thou,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>if thou had≈øt known in this thy day,</hi> &amp;c. but now they <hi>are hid from thine eyes:</hi> and when once a People grow up to this heighth, to reject the Go≈øpel, then expect ≈øome fearful Judgment. Read the la≈øt Chapter of <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles,</hi> the ≈øecond Book, and at the 16. Ver≈øe, and them you will ≈øee, when the wrath of God is like to break our upon a people without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, If you would have the continual abode of God and Chri≈øt with you, Let God have all your thoughts, let him be your meditation; this is the way to have the be≈øt company when you be
<pb facs="tcp:62760:228"/>alone: <hi>David</hi> would meditate of him day and night, and profe≈ø≈øed <hi>the meditation of him ≈øhould be ≈øweet to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here con≈øider two particulars:</p>
            <list>
               <item>Fir≈øt, Con≈øider that no place, ≈øtate or condition, can hinder the ≈øoul of this way of ≈øecret communion with God and Chri≈øt; this priviledge could not be denied to a <hi>benighted Jacob,</hi> to an <hi>impri≈øoned Jeremy,</hi> to an <hi>exil'd John</hi> in <hi>Patmos;</hi> by this (≈øays <hi>Jerome</hi>) <hi>Solitudo fit Paradi≈øus,</hi> a man may turn a <hi>Wilderne≈øs</hi> into a <hi>Paradi≈øe;</hi> and therefore we read in <hi>Cant.</hi> 11.12. how the Spou≈øe invites Chri≈øt to go with her, as <hi>I≈øaac</hi> did into the Fields to meditate, <hi>Come let's go into the Fields, and lodge in the Villages.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Secondly, Con≈øider in the≈øe ≈øecret ≈øilent vi≈øits of the Soul, God and Chri≈øt do take abundance of delight; our Night-thoughts, our Field-thoughts, our Clo≈øet-thoughts, are very welcome to them; yea, when we can do no more but think of God, our very thoughts ≈øhall be an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted ≈øervice, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.13. <hi>He loveth the Fig-tree that putteth forth her green Figges.</hi> The ripe fruit is in the bud: ≈øo, holy endeavours in pure breathings and de≈øires, God accepts, when our Infirmity, or the Iniquity of the Times may be ≈øuch, that we can doe no more.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Seventhly, If we will have God and Chri≈øt to make their con≈øtant abode with us, then let us walk humbly with God. He that beholds the proud afar off, will be nigh to them that humble their Souls under his mighty hand, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 57.15. <hi>Thus ≈øays the high and lofty One, that inhabits eternity, who≈øe Name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place; with him al≈øo, that is of an humble and contrite ≈øpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God hath two Heavens in which he dwells.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Fir≈øt, His Glory dwells in the high and holy place in Heaven above.</item>
               <item>Secondly, His Grace dwells in the humble and lowly ≈øpirit. <hi>Here will I dwell, ≈øays God.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Eighthly, If you would have the con≈øtant abode of God and Chri≈øt with you, be ≈øure to look to your Hearts, that you walk in your up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightne≈øs: be true to the Word of God, be true to your profe≈ø≈øion. There is not in the world a more lively repre≈øentation and image of God, than the heart of the upright: therefore God loves ≈øo much, when he hath drawn his likene≈øs upon them, to walk with them, therefore <hi>David</hi> re≈øolves, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 101.2. <hi>I will walk in the mid≈øt of my hou≈øe with a perfect
<pb facs="tcp:62760:228"/>heart: O when wilt thou come unto me?</hi> This was the comfort of the Apo≈øtle, that in ≈øimplicity and godly ≈øincerity, he had his conver≈øation in the world; God will be with ≈øuch, and ≈øuch ≈øhall be with God, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 37.37. <hi>Mark the perfect man, behold the upright, the end of that man is peace:</hi> And thus God appointed <hi>Abraham</hi> to walk, that he might be with him a God in Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>Walk before me, be thou perfect,</hi> and gives him this incouragement, <hi>I am God all-≈øufficient:</hi> God's all-≈øufficiency being ≈øufficient to keep the ≈øoul upright, being rightly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>
            <p>There be two things which u≈øually bia≈øs the ≈øoul away from God, and makes it warp from its holy principles. Fir≈øt, the Frowns; Secondly, the Flatteries of the world.</p>
            <p>Again≈øt both which, there is a ≈øufficient remedy in the <hi>All-≈øufficient God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, That which often perverts the ≈øoul from the truth, is the <hi>fear of troubles and wants;</hi> If I keep my integrity (≈øays the ≈øoul) I ≈øhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, I ≈øhall lo≈øe my e≈øtate, embroyl my ≈øelf in many troubles; perhaps a <hi>Pri≈øon, Exile,</hi> or <hi>Death</hi> comes next. But what force is there in this tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? if we hear on the other hand God ≈øaying, If thou wilt be upright, fear no troubles, no wants, <hi>I am a God All-≈øufficient,</hi> as in <hi>Job</hi> 22.25. to the end of the Chapter, <hi>The Almighty ≈øhall be thy defence,</hi> (then fear not force) <hi>Thou ≈øhalt have plenty of ≈øilver, thou ≈øhalt gather gold as du≈øt, and the gold of</hi> Ophir <hi>as the ≈øtones of the Brooks.</hi> Then fear no wants.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is another thing in the world that hath a very great influence upon the ≈øpirit of a man, to pervert him, and turn him from his integrity; and that is <hi>the hopes of preferment, and greatne≈øs of the world:</hi> But this is but a poor bait, if we look upon the <hi>All-≈øufficiency of God:</hi> Doth the world promi≈øe thee <hi>Riches?</hi> God will out-bid the world, and give Eternal riches. Will the world give <hi>Plea≈øures?</hi> God will give better; <hi>with him is fullne≈øs of joy, and plea≈øures for evermore.</hi> Will the world give <hi>Gold?</hi> God will give <hi>Diamonds.</hi> Will the world give all its glory? God will give thee the glory of a <hi>better world,</hi> rather than that ≈øhall be a ≈ønare unto thee.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Pray much, pray continually; God will be in the hearts and hou≈øes of his praying people, when he hath a cur≈øe in ≈øtore for <hi>Prayerle≈øs Families,</hi> in <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.15.</p>
            <p>And e≈øpecially pray for the≈øe two things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Fir≈øt, That God will abide with you and the Kingdom in his Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:229"/>and pure Ordinances: that you may dwell in <hi>Bethel,</hi> and not in <hi>Bethaven,</hi> a hou≈øe of vanity and grief. Pray that God would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move his <hi>Candle≈øtick</hi> from you, not utterly extingui≈øh the light of the Kingdom.</item>
               <item>Secondly, Pray, and I ≈øhall pray with you, that God will give you a faithful Pa≈øtour after his own heart, not according to your hearts, that he may teach you by his Doctrine and his Life too; a faithful Teacher, to go in and out before you, to ≈øhew you the Word of the Lord; one that may be among you, as it was ≈øaid of <hi>Athana≈øius,</hi> that he was <hi>Magnes &amp; Adamas.</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Magnes,</hi> As a Load-≈øtone, to draw your ≈øouls with a gentle hand and melting heart from your ≈øins <hi>Heaven-ward.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Adamas,</hi> as an Adamant, of an invincible courage and zeal again≈øt all ≈øin and prophanene≈øs; one that will not ≈øpare ≈øin that he may ≈øave your ≈øouls.</item>
                  </list>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Pray that God would give you a Star, a Star out of his right hand, not a churli≈øh <hi>Orion,</hi> that brings a cold, barren, and cloudy Winter, but a benevolent and friendly <hi>Pleiades,</hi> that there may be many Sons brought in to God, and your ≈øouls may finde a continual ≈øpring, and that you may be as Trees of his own planting, <hi>And may flouri≈øh in the Courts of the Hou≈øe of our God, And may bring forth fruit in old age.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tenthly, and la≈øtly, If you would have the con≈øtant abode of God and Chri≈øt with you, conform; conform univer≈øally and fully to the Go≈øpel of Chri≈øt, con≈øent and a≈ø≈øent unfeignedly to all the Truths and Doctrines thereof, that you may walk worthy of God, and all that grace which hath been revealed to you; for Chri≈øt hath ≈øaid, <hi>If a man keep his Word, the Father will love him,</hi> and both Father and Son will come, <hi>and make their abode with him.</hi> Wherefore I ≈øhall conclude this Exhortation with that of the Apo≈øtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.2, 7. <hi>Only let your conver≈øation be ≈øuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the Go≈øpel of Chri≈øt, that whether I come and ≈øee you, or el≈øe be ab≈øent from you, I may hear of your affairs, that ye ≈øtand fa≈øt in one ≈øpirit, with one minde, ≈øtriving together for the faith of the Go≈øpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to ≈øhut up all with that in <hi>Acts</hi> 20.32.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now Brethren, I commend you to God and to the Word of his Grace, which is able to build you up, and give you an inheritance among all them which are ≈øanctified.</hi>

               <q>Who≈øoever believeth that Je≈øus is the Chri≈øt, is born of God; and every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him al≈øo that is begotten of him. Little Children, keep your ≈øelves from Idols.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THis general Doctrine I have already delivered unto you from this Text, which indeed is the marrow and ≈øub≈øtance of the whole Chapter; <hi>That Go≈øpel-believing is a duty, which they that really perform, are highly priviledged by, to their greate≈øt advantage.</hi> I have ≈øpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Go≈øpel-believing, and that is a duty, and that they that do really perform it are highly dignified and priviledged by it, as hath been made to appear from the Chapter; that which remains to be done, and ≈øhall be, as God enables the work of this morning, is to make improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Doctrine, which is one of the mo≈øt material and momentous Doctrines that can be preached to us. Go≈øpel-believing it hath mo≈øt precious priviledges entailed upon it; Who≈øoever believeth that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus is the Chri≈øt, that Je≈øus is the Son of God, that Je≈øus is come in the Fle≈øh; is born of God, knows God, and ≈øhall be eternally ble≈ø≈øed of God, and with God; ≈øurely then the world runs upon a very great mi≈øtake. I have hinted ≈øomething already to that purpo≈øe, but I have left the more full di≈øcu≈ø≈øion and di≈øcovery of the matter untill now. Why, who is there among the generality of common Profe≈ø≈øors that is not very pregnant to hold forth this to be their Faith? If ≈øo be that it ≈øhould be put to the Que≈øtion, Friend, what is your Faith? What be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief are you of? Why? not one in a thou≈øand, I think, but will be apt to ≈øay, Why truly, I will give you this account; There is a Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb facs="tcp:62760:230"/>Go≈øpel which is preached among us<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and in the world, and this Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpel doth hold forth this for true Doctrine, that Je≈øus the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> that was born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> is the Chri≈øt, is the Me≈ø≈øiah which was promi≈øed by the Father, and which the world did live in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of ≈øo long, This Je≈øus I believe is the Son of God, this Je≈øus I verily believe is come in the fle≈øh, and he is come to be the Saviour of the world: This is the Belief, and that which is the common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øion that is made by the generality of people. Why, but will you con≈øider now, this Text, and other Scriptures do ≈øpeak fully to the purpo≈øe; Who≈øoever doth believe this, that Je≈øus is the Chri≈øt, the Son of God, and that he is come in the fle≈øh, who≈øoever believes this, is of God, is born of God. And it doth clearly appear, and may be mo≈øt convincingly made out, that many thou≈øands that profe≈øs their belief concerning the≈øe things, yet notwith≈øtanding are not born of God. Why, certainly there mu≈øt needs be a great fallacy in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈øs: Go≈øpel-faith and Believing, it is not ≈øo common a thing as many take it to be, and therefore if this be Go≈øpel-faith, and that which doth intere≈øt per≈øons in ≈øuch great and precious priviledges, truly it concerns us to look well to it, that we be not mi≈øtaken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this belief. Now this I would ≈øay, there is ≈øomething in it to be con≈øidered with re≈øpect to the time wherein Chri≈øt appeared vi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the world, and the after-times wherein the Apo≈øtles did hold forth the≈øe great Doctrines of the Go≈øpel concerning Chri≈øt. And this we are to ≈øay, that in ≈øuch a time as that was, when this was the critical point as it were, the di≈øcriminating thing, in ≈øuch a time for any to make this Profe≈ø≈øion, and to hold forth this to be their Faith and Belief, that Je≈øus is the Chri≈øt, the Son of God, it was of high ≈øignification; and might very well, as to man, beget a comfortable confidence and hope concerning ≈øuch per≈øons, that certainly they were born of God, as to man, and according to rational Charity it might be very comfortable that ≈øuch per≈øons as did thus believe, and profe≈øs this to be their Faith and Belief, there were ≈øome ble≈ø≈øed beam upon their Souls; for mark you, it hath been thus in the world, and among the people of it concerning matters of God and Godline≈øs, that there hath been ≈øuch and ≈øuch a Truth, that hath been the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Truth, as I ≈øaid; that hath been, as I may ≈øo ≈øay, the <hi>Shibboleth</hi> whereby people are di≈øtingui≈øhed one from another. I allude to that pa≈ø≈øage in the Book of <hi>Judges,</hi> concerning the <hi>Gileadites;</hi> they made a
<pb facs="tcp:62760:230"/>profe≈ø≈øion of them≈øelves to be ≈øuch and ≈øuch, and they were put to it to pronounce <hi>Shiboleth;</hi> they that could not ≈øpeak out the word, and clearly pronounce it, they were not judged to be per≈øons that they profe≈ø≈øed them≈øelves to be; but they that could do it held their liberty; ≈øo ≈øuch and ≈øuch a Doctrine is ordered out to be a di≈øtingui≈øhing point, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the de≈øperate oppo≈øition that the world makes again≈øt it; and upon this account the Prie≈øts, and the Rulers, and the re≈øt of the world were de≈øperately bent again≈øt Je≈øus; they called him Je≈øus, but could not endure him to be called <hi>Chri≈øt the Son of God;</hi> it was an Act and Decree among≈øt them, <hi>That who≈øoever ≈øhould confe≈øs</hi> Je≈øus <hi>to be</hi> Chri≈øt, <hi>≈øhould be put out of the Synogogue, ≈øhould be excommunicated.</hi> Now for per≈øons at ≈øuch time, wherein it was as much as their liberty, it may be their lives we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> worth, to own that <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt was the Son of God,</hi> for per≈øons now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>t ≈øuch a time to own this Je≈øus, that was in ≈øo mean a condition, to be the Chri≈øt, there is very much in it, infinitely more, than for per≈øons now to take up this profe≈ø≈øion.</p>
            <p>Why? becau≈øe this Doctrine hath obtained in the world, and it is a Doctrine among Papi≈øts as well as Prote≈øtants; there is no ≈øuch danger now for per≈øons to be of this belief. But ≈øhall I ≈øay this, that for all that to believe this really according to the right account, and true genuine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of Go≈øpel-believing, the ca≈øe is the ≈øame with them and with us at this day, ≈øetting a≈øide the con≈øideration of times and time; the danger then, and the encouragement now; the Ca≈øe is the ≈øame, Go≈øpel-believing of the≈øe truths according to a genuine interpretation of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpel-believing, it is the ≈øame now as then, and then as now: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we mu≈øt con≈øider and look further.</p>
            <p>I would put the≈øe few things to your Con≈øciences; You profe≈øs this to be your Faith, you believe that <hi>Je≈øus is the Chri≈øt, the Son of God,</hi> that he is come in the fle≈øh; the≈øe things you profe≈øs to believe, &amp; if you do ≈øo indeed you are highly privileged people, ble≈ø≈øed of God, &amp; ≈øhal be to all eternity but do you not mi≈øtake, Do you believe this, that <hi>Je≈øus is the Chri≈øt?</hi> How came you by this belief? What account can you give of it? How were you brought over to this belief? Did you not come to this Faith and belief by common report? You were born to this Doctrine; you look upon it as that which is the benefit you have by your being born in a Nation, and among a people that profe≈øs the Name of Chri≈øt, and this hath been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtilled
<pb facs="tcp:62760:231"/>into you by Education, and upon this account you take it: Did you ever buy this truth? It is a Truth, that Je≈øus is the Chri≈øt, How came i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>to be yours? Did you ever buy this Truth? Buy it? I ≈øay buy it. For the very Truth is, we are never able to make a good Title to any Scripture-Truth, untill ≈øuch time as we can ≈øay, we have bought it: How, why, by ≈øerious meditation, ≈øtudying the Scriptures, ≈øearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into them, ≈øeriou≈øly pondering and weighing of them, crying mightily to God, that he would manife≈øt them to us, and encountring temptations from without, and from within, being at a point, willing to engage liberty and e≈øtate, and life, and all for this Truths ≈øake: Can you ≈øay, we have pondered, and are ≈øo fully ≈øatisfied about it, as that if all the World ≈øhould come in a way of contradiction, and ri≈øe up in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition to us, and come with fire and ≈øword to beat us out of this Truth, yet we are re≈øolved to ≈øtick to it? Can you give ≈øuch an account of your ≈øelves, That you have not taken it up upon a common report, but are able to ≈øay, there hath been an inward Revelation made of the≈øe things to your Souls, that there hath been a ≈øanctified work of the Spirit upon your under≈øtanding, that you come to ≈øee into the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtery of the≈øe Go≈øpel-Te≈øtimonies? Is there an habitual frame of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit wrought in you, whereby you are carryed out to clo≈øe with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Truth of God, and to clo≈øe with it upon this account, becau≈øe of a Divine Authority ≈øtampt upon it? When we give a≈ø≈øent to common Truths, but not with a common ≈øpirit, but in the ≈øtrength of an inward conviction, we a≈ø≈øent to it upon the account of an Unction that we have received from the Holy One; and we a≈ø≈øent to this and that truth upon the account of a Divine Authority which we ≈øee to be ≈øtampt upon it, and withall we finde that there are ≈øuitable work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of our heart in the loves, and de≈øires, and delights of them, to the≈øe Truths (as there will be a kindly working of the heart, where there is a right a≈ø≈øent ≈øuitable to the Truths a≈ø≈øented to;) as if there be a Threatning, the Soul a≈ø≈øents to it, and will tremble before God: If a Promi≈øe be made, or a Go≈øpel-Revelation, it will be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a holy rejoycing in God, that ever he ≈øhould make ≈øuch a Promi≈øe or Revelation; and then there will be a holy re≈øolution of Spirit, Come what will come, I will never part with this Truth; I have bought the Truth, that was my duty; and having bought it, I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb facs="tcp:62760:231"/>≈øell it, that is my duty too; can we give ≈øuch an account as this? But then withal, let me a little further improve that which I have already ≈øpoke from the Chapter.</p>
            <p>You ≈øay, this is your belief, that Je≈øus is the Chri≈øt, the Son of GOD; but can you give an account of tho≈øe priviledges that are entailed upon this belief? For you mu≈øt know that the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges which belong to ≈øuch, will ≈øerve as evidences that they are ≈øuch.</p>
            <p>Now if you believe, it is your priviledge to be born of God; and this being born of God mu≈øt be the evidence of this belief. Can you give an account of your being born of God? If you are not born of God, you do not believe, That Je≈øus is the Chri≈øt. Can you give an account of your overcoming the World? Are you ≈øuch as are enabled to ≈øtand out in oppo≈øition to the Errours, and Here≈øies, and corrupt Doctrines and Practi≈øes that are in the World? Can you bear up again≈øt the lu≈øt of the Eye, the lu≈øt of the Fle≈øh, and the pride of Life? If you are in ≈ølavery to the World, in bondage to the beggarly Rudiments of the world, you are mi≈øtaken, if you believe That Je≈øus is the Chri≈øt: For, he that believeth, according to the true interpretation of Go≈øpel-believing, That Je≈øus is the Chri≈øt, doth over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the World, and by vertue of this belief, he is enabled to get a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øt over the World, and over the Corruptions that are in it through lu≈øt.</p>
            <p>And then again, you profe≈øs to believe that Je≈øus is the Chri≈øt, the Son of God: Oh! but are you able to give an account that you have believed into this Je≈øus, and upon this Je≈øus? For that is it the Text holds forth: He that believes that Je≈øus is the Chri≈øt, doth believe on Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus the Chri≈øt: Are you by vertue of this believing which you profe≈øs, drawn out to a clo≈øing with Chri≈øt? Do you roll your ≈øelves upon him? Own him for Righteou≈øne≈øs and Salvation, and are willing to yield your ≈øelves up in ≈øubjection to him? You believe Je≈øus to be the Chri≈øt; but do you believe on that Je≈øus whom you profe≈øs to be the Chri≈øt? Now this being thus laid down as a Foundation, I would inferr thus, and ≈øo go on to a farther branch of this Application; Either you do real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe with a Go≈øpel-believing the Truths and Doctrines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chri≈øt, or you do not: Why, they that do profe≈øs they do,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:232"/>but in truth they do not, there is a clear and manife≈øt contradiction which this profe≈ø≈øion meets withal, and that upon the accounts I have formerly given, as alas, this profe≈ø≈øion ≈øuffers contradiction generally; generally the Profe≈ø≈øours of this Faith, That Je≈øus is Chri≈øt, doe clearly make a flat contradiction; and I am very confident that there are thou≈øands, that if they ≈øhould be put to the trial, Will you ≈øtick to this truth? If you do, it ≈øhall co≈øt you the lo≈ø≈øe of your Liberty, and E≈øtates: Nay, your Life ≈øhall go for it. Oh! I am very apt to think, that you ≈øhall have thou≈øands that will turn their backs upon this Profe≈ø≈øion, renounce this Profe≈ø≈øion. Now concerning ≈øuch, this I would ≈øay,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, That the condition of ≈øuch per≈øons as are not right in Go≈øpel-believing, is a mo≈øt mournful and mi≈øerable condition; however it may be with them in other re≈øpects, yet it is ≈øad to think what a condition they are in: for con≈øider fir≈øt of all, they that do not perform this great duty of Go≈øpel-believing, according to the truth and reality of it, I will tell you what they do, they do give God the lye, they do, by interpretation, tell God to his face that he is a very Liar; and what higher bla≈øpheming can there be, than to give the lye to the God of Truth! every one will be apt to ble≈øs them≈øelves, and ≈øay, Oh far be it from me, God forbid that I ≈øhould be charged with ≈øuch a horrid impiety as this! Oh, but Brethren, the very truth is, it is a very common thing by interpretation to give the lye to God: and all that do not believe according to that Go≈øpel-belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that you have heard, do tell God to his face that he is a Liar. How doth that appear? Why take a little help, ≈øuch I am able to give you; To profe≈øs that Je≈øus is the Chri≈øt, the Son of God, that he came to be the Saviour of the World, is ordered out to be our Righteou≈øne≈øs, is ≈øent of God to preach Liberty to captives, to heal di≈øea≈øed ≈øouls, and to deliver poor creatures from the bondage of the Devil; the≈øe things people ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally profe≈øs to believe: but mark you now, they never come to Chri≈øt, nor never ≈øet in with him upon this account, and to this purpo≈øe, O Lord thou art the Je≈øus, the Anointed of God; I come to thee for life, I am a poor dead creature, I am in a ≈øtate of unrighteou≈øne≈øs, and thou art given to be for righteou≈øne≈øs; Lord I flye to thee for it, I am a poor di≈øea≈øed creature; the Plague is ≈øet upon my ≈øoul, and thou art appointed to heal the Soul of the Plague; I come to thee for healing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:232"/>There is not one of thou≈øands that come thus to Chri≈øt. Will you now ≈øee how the lye is given to God? I profe≈øs for my part, ≈øaith one, I know no ≈øuch matter (Je≈øus is the Chri≈øt, and I profe≈øs to believe ≈øo, and he is appointed of God for ≈øuch and ≈øuch things; he is ≈øent to preach liberty to the captives; I know not that there is ≈øuch bondage. Chri≈øt came to ≈øave ≈øinners; alas, I know no need of any ≈øuch ≈øalvation by him, he came to heal di≈øea≈øed Souls; I am well enough, what need have I of Chri≈øt? What is this but to give the lye to God? He that receives not Chri≈øt, makes God a liar; for he doth in effect ≈øay, Lord, thou ≈øaye≈øt ≈øo and ≈øo concerning the World, I know nothing of all this, and ≈øo the lye is given to God. And is it nothing to give the lye to the great God, the God of Truth? And I tell you, while you profe≈øs this Je≈øus to be the Chri≈øt, the Son of God, and in the mean time flye not to him, you believe him to be the Son of God, and that all authority is given unto him, and you will not ≈øubject to his authority, why you give the lye to God, and is this nothing?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Con≈øider the ≈øad condition of ≈øuch as believe not according to a right Go≈øpel-believing, they are ≈øuch as are liable to the dreadfule≈øt touches from the Devil that po≈ø≈øibly can be: He that believeth is born of God, overcomes the World, and is enabled to keep him≈øelf, that the wicked one doth not touch him with a mortiferous touch: But I tell thee, whatever thou art, that are under the power of unbelief, thou are in danger of a dreadful touch from the Prince of Darkne≈øs: And if thou live≈øt and die≈øt in a ≈øtate of unbelief, thou wilt fall under the power of condemnation. I remember what our Saviour ≈øpeaks, and con≈øider well of it: <hi>You ≈øtand out in oppo≈øition to my Doctrine, but I tell you, Except you believe I am he, you ≈øhall dye in your ≈øins;</hi> a dreadful word, <hi>you ≈øhall dye in your ≈øins,</hi> and what then? <hi>be damned eternally:</hi> this is the condition of all ≈øuch as are in a ≈øtate of unbelief: But then on the other hand, in ca≈øe we be able to give a good account of our believing that Je≈øus is Chri≈øt, the Son of God, and of our believing on him concerning whom the≈øe Te≈øtimonies are given.

And all the priviledges of the Go≈øpel are entailed upon you, and you are entitled unto them, and you ≈øhall have the benefit of them while you live, and when you dye, unto all eternity; well may it be ≈øaid of ≈øuch a per≈øon, Ble≈ø≈øed is be and ≈øhe that hath believed with a Go≈øpel-belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, Go≈øpel-Truths, and Te≈øtimonies concerning Chri≈øt, and on Chri≈øt, on whom tho≈øe Te≈øtimonies are given, for there ≈øhall be a full and perfect accompli≈øhment of what ever God hath ≈øpoken with his mouth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ≈øuch.</p>

            <p>Oh Brethren, let us con≈øider well, our Saviour tells us in <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. <hi>Wi≈ødom is ju≈øtified of her Children:</hi> Why, if ever we mean to approve our ≈øelves to be Wi≈ødoms Children, our care mu≈øt be for to give in our Ju≈øtification of Wi≈ødoms ≈øayings, and for to carry it in a congruou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and ≈øuitablene≈øs unto that Go≈øpel-believing which we profe≈øs to be by grace brought over to.

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:233"/>Why fir≈øt of all, this one ≈øpecial duty that lies upon you, That you would ≈øtudy your mercy, and know what God hath been to you, and done for you, and how highly you are dignified, and not be always in a fluctuating ≈øtate, and upon the que≈øtioning and di≈øputing point, but to come to ≈øome well grounded confidence, that you may be able to ≈øay, We know that this and that is our condition, and this and that is our dignified priviledge, that we are planted under.</p>
            <p>Do but mark how the point in hand doth charge this upon us, in the thirteenth Ver≈øe of this Chapter, <hi>The≈øe things have I writ to you that believe on the Name of the Son of God, That you may know that you have eternall life.</hi> Here is your duty according to what the Text it ≈øelf doth charge upon you; if you be ≈øuch as by grace are brought o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to a Go≈øpel-believing, the Apo≈øtle <hi>John</hi> that did write this Epi≈øtle, and I from it, preach unto you, in the Name of the Lord, and by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from him, that this is your duty, to know that you are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons that have eternal life, that you are ≈øuch as Chri≈øt by his Bloud hath made a purcha≈øe of eternal life for; that he hath by his Bloud once for all entred into the holy place, that is not made with hands, that he may prepare for you, and that you might have the po≈ø≈øe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of tho≈øe ble≈ø≈øed Man≈øions, that he hath made preparation of</p>

Oh! It is a ≈øad condition, infinitely more ≈øad, than for a man to lie in the mo≈øt noy≈øome≈øt ≈øtinking Ditch, or in the loath≈øome≈øt kennel, why this is that that heightens the mercy to poor ≈øouls that are called by grace according to the purpo≈øe of God, that while the whole world lies in wickedne≈øs, and ≈øo are like to lie: yea, and to lie in Hell to all eternity, that God ≈øhould plea≈øe to lay you in the bo≈øom of his Son, and to take you into the arms of his mercy; this is that, that ≈øhould heighten our thankfulne≈øs. I may make u≈øe of that expre≈ø≈øion which we find in <hi>Acts</hi> the fourth, when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> came unto a company of heathens, and they ≈øaw what great things were done by them, and took notice of the gracious ≈øpirit that they di≈øcovered; ≈øure, ≈øay they, The Gods are come among us in the likene≈øs of <hi>men.</hi> Con≈øidering the ≈øtate of times, and what a height of wickedne≈øs many at this day are grown up unto the dreadful ≈øwearing, bla≈øpheming of God and his ways: tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judge of it your ≈øelves, whether we may not ≈øay the Devils are come among us in the likene≈øs of men. Why now, Oh! how ≈øhould we heighten our love and thankfulne≈øs to God, that ≈øhould plea≈øe in free grace to bring us over to clo≈øe with Je≈øus Chri≈øt!</p>
            <p>But then 4 as many as are brought over to <hi>Go≈øpel-believing,</hi> this is your duty to ≈øtudy, and endeavour what you can your advantages in faith; and ≈øo the Apo≈øtle gives it in charge here in the Chapter in v. 13. <hi>The≈øe things have I writ to you that believe on the Name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe on the Son of God.</hi> This is that you ≈øhould ≈øet about, if God hath brought you over to a clo≈øing with Chri≈øt, and an embracing of the Te≈øtimonies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, believe more and more, labor for your advancement, and let it be your prayer, <hi>Good Lord encrea≈øe our faith:</hi> labor that you may be clear <hi>in your apprehen≈øions of go≈øpel-my≈øteries,</hi> and that <hi>you may be more ≈øtrong in your adherence to Chri≈øt,</hi> of whom <hi>tho≈øe Go≈øpel-te≈øtimonies are given, and

            <p>Yet further, fifthly, This is to be given in charge to ≈øuch as do believe according to the Go≈øpel, that they carry it ≈øuitably to a believing ≈øtate, as in tho≈øe particulars that I have in≈øi≈øted upon, ≈øo in a deportment congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ≈øutable to the privileges which belong to believing: You are born of God, carry it as men and women that are ≈øo indeed: what I born of God? the ≈øons and daughters of God?

I remember what he ≈øpeaks there concerning <hi>Amnon, How is it, that thou bring the Kings ≈øon, art lean from day to day?</hi> How is it, that we that profe≈øs to be the ≈øons and daughters of God, are lean and lank, not more improved? that we do not ≈øhew forth God and expre≈øs Chri≈øt? This lies in the beginning of the Chapter, <hi>If you be born of God, remember that you be born of him that is the God of Love:</hi> And therefore you are to manife≈øt this birth, and your believing, and your being born of God, by loving God, and by loving them that are born of God; <hi>He that believeth is born of God, and be that loveth him that begat, loveth him that is begotten of him.</hi> The God of love doth beget a people of love; a loving God, a loving people; and this is that you ≈øhould expre≈øs your believing by, and your adoption by, by the love you bear to God, and the children of God.</p>
            <p>A hateful, ≈øpiteful ≈øpirit, where it doth di≈øcover it ≈øelf, ≈øpeaks tho≈øe per≈øons not to be born of God, but of the Devil; carry it as Believers, as per≈øons of God, by ≈øtudying a conformity to God, and by keeping his Commandments, ≈øubjecting your ≈øelves to his authority, not living ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your lu≈øts, but according to the laws and rules which God hath given you, ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle here, <hi>This is the love of God, that we keep his Commandments.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:62760:236"/>Lambs Book of Life, are prevailed to perform the wor≈øhip with the Bea≈øt, and not being writ there, mu≈øt be tumbled into the Lake for ever.</p>
            <p>This therefore concerns us to keep from Idolatry, from whatever hath a tendency that way, and that hath any tincture of Super≈øtition upon it; and con≈øider with your ≈øelves, that our Duty is in matters of Wor≈øhip, and in things concerning the Wor≈øhip of God, to ≈øee to it, that we keep a humble dependance upon God, that we walk not according to the will of Men, but according to the will of God; <hi>You were bought with a price, be not ≈øervants of men.</hi> We are to walk by a Line, by a Plummet, and what is not warranted by the Word of God, or maintainable by Argument drawn from it, we ≈øhould not clo≈øe with.</p>
            <p>And for the clo≈øing up of all, do but con≈øider how this Chapter; and the things that I have ≈øpoken to you, and preached from it, how they do all influence this Exhortation, <hi>Little Children, keep your ≈øelves from Idols;</hi> ≈øee to it, that you approve your ≈øelves in holy Wor≈øhip to God and the Lord Je≈øus. Do but argue thus; You profe≈øs to be Believers, and is it not your duty to an≈øwer to this profe≈ø≈øion? Your Falth is a pure Faith, and an obediential grace; it is a grace that will tutor you to hang upon Chri≈øt, and his appointments and In≈øtitutions; and therefore being Believers, ≈øtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to keep your ≈øelves from Idols, and whatever is not con≈øonant to the will of God concerning Wor≈øhip.</p>
            <p>You believe that Je≈øus is the Chri≈øt, the Son of God, keep your ≈øelves from Idols in this re≈øpect; for he is come into the world, and hath ≈øhewed the pattern of his Hou≈øe; and then you are born of God: carry it like a people that are born of God, that are high born, and credit your holy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øion, by keeping a dependance upon that God, of whom you are born: and then being Believers, you are born of God, and have overcome the world, and therefore ≈øhew forth your heroick ≈øpirit, by ≈øtanding out in all oppo≈øition to Idols, and whatever is contrary to ≈øound Doctrine, and the power of godline≈øs.</p>
            <p>You have an Unction from the Holy One, and this engages you to look to it, that you keep your ≈øelves from Idols: <hi>And then we know</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>that the Son of God is come, and hath given us under≈øtanding that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> And thereupon he brings in this, <hi>Little Children; keep your ≈øelves from Idols:</hi> as if he ≈øhould ≈øay, This is the true God, God in Chri≈øt, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt the Son of the Father, this is the true God, and he hath eternal life with him; other god are fal≈øe gods, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>And now yet one word more. I would not occa≈øion any di≈øcompo≈øure of ≈øpirit that is not becoming you: But this I mu≈øt ≈øay, for ought I know, you have the words of a dying man, and we u≈øe to ≈øay, that the words of dying men are apt to take ≈øomewhat a deep impre≈ø≈øion; I mean a dying man, not in properne≈øs of ≈øpeech according to nature; and if it ≈øhould be ≈øo, I hope there would be cau≈øe of rejoycing on my part: but I ≈øpeak the words of a dying man in re≈øpect of the Mini≈øterial Office.</p>
            <p>I ≈øuppo≈øe you all know there is an Act come forth by Supream Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and it is not for us to quarrel at all, but to ≈øubmit to it, and hold cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øpondency with it ≈øo far as we can, with a good con≈øcience; and there being many Injunctions, that many, be≈øides my ≈øelf cannot comply with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, therefore we are willing to ≈øubmit to the Penalty inflicted.</p>
            <p>This I ≈øay, you have for many years had the benefit of my poor La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; I have fulfilled near up towards forty years, and have perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ≈øervice to God, Chri≈øt, and his People, and I ble≈øs his Name, not without acceptance and ≈øucce≈øs. My work, ≈øo far I know, in this cour≈øe, as in the weekly cour≈øe, is now at an end; my de≈øire is, that you who≈øe hearts have been inclinable to wait upon God in the way of my Mini≈øtry, may be kept faithful to God, and that you may have the ble≈ø≈øing of the everla≈øting Covenant coming upon your Souls, and that you may have the power of this Doctrine, held forth in this Sermon, put forth upon your hearts; that as you do believe that Je≈øus is the Chri≈øt, that as you profe≈øs the≈øe things, you may carry it ≈øuitably to your profe≈ø≈øion, that you may walk in love to God, love to Chri≈øt, and love to one another; that you may labour to manife≈øt a noble generous Spirit in overcoming the world in Errours, Corruptions, fal≈øe Doctrines, and unwarrantable Wor≈øhip; that you may in all things labour to approve your ≈øelves: <hi>And littlte Children keep your ≈øelves from Idols,</hi> Amen.</p>

            <p>I an≈øwer, this Ark was the holie≈øt of all the things of God; it was ≈øo holy that it made every place holy where it came, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 8.11. <hi>And Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh, out of the City of</hi> David, <hi>into the hou≈øe that he had built for her, for he ≈øaid, my Wife ≈øhall not dwell in the hou≈øe of</hi> David <hi>King of I≈ørael, becau≈øe the places are holy whereunto the Ark of the Lord hath come.</hi> This Ark was the dwelling place of God, it was the habitation of God, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 99.1. <hi>The Lord reigneth, he ≈øitteth between the Cherubins.</hi> Now the≈øe Cherubins were placed over the Ark<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> it was the ≈øpeaking place of God, he met his people there, and there he gave an an≈øwer to them: <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.21, 22. <hi>And thou ≈øhalt put the Mercy-≈øeat, above upon the Ark, and in the Ark thou ≈øhalt put the te≈øtimony that I ≈øhall give thee: And there will I meet with the, and I will commune with thee from above the Mercy-≈øeat, from above the two Cherubins, which are upon the Ark of the Te≈øtimony, of all things I ≈øhall give thee in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment unto the children of I≈ørael.</hi> This Ark was Gods Foot-≈øtool, and all the pleople of God wor≈øhip him before the Foot-≈øtool of God. <hi>P≈ø.</hi> 99.5. <hi>Exalt ye the Lord our God, and wor≈øhip at his foot-≈øtool, for he is holy.</hi> The Ark, it was the glory and the ≈øtrength of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> P≈øal. 78.61. <hi>And he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his ≈øtrength into captivity, and his glory into his enemies bands; and it was the terrour of the enemies of God:</hi> And therefore when the Ark came into the battel, the <hi>Phili≈øtines</hi> were afraid, and ≈øaid, <hi>Woe unto us; for God is come down into the Camp.</hi> And indeed this Ark was called <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah,</hi> Num. 10.35. <hi>And it ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <item>Secondly, it was a Type of the Church of <hi>Chri≈øt;</hi> for as the Ark was the pre≈øerver of the two Tables of the Law, ≈øo the Church of Chri≈øt is the pre≈øervative of the Scriptures.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, the Ark was a Type of the Ordinances of Chri≈øt; for as God did communicate him≈øelf by the Ark, ≈øo God by his Ordinances communicates his Coun≈øels, Comforts, and Grace unto his people; The Ordinances of Chri≈øt they are the <hi>

            </list>
            <p>I ≈øhall gather two ob≈øervations from the words.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>That when the Ark of God is in danger of being lo≈øt, the people of God have thoughtful heads and trembling hearts.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>That a true Child of God is more troubled, and more ≈øolicitous what ≈øhall become of the Ark, than what ≈øhall become of Wife and Children or E≈øtate.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>I ≈øhall begin with the fir≈øt Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That when the Aak of God is in danger of being lo≈øt, the people of God have thoughtful heads and trembling hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or, if I may put this Doctrine in a Go≈øpel dre≈øs, take it thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That when the Go≈øpel is in danger of lo≈øing, when Go≈øpel-Ordinances are in danger of being lo≈øt, and Go≈øpel-Mini≈øters in danger of lo≈øing, that then the people of God have trembling heads, and careful and ≈øolicitous hearts about it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mark what I ≈øay: I ≈øay not when the Ark is lo≈øt; for that was death to old <hi>Eli,</hi> that broke his neck: and it co≈øt the life of <hi>Eli</hi>'s Daughter-in-Law, when the Ark of God was taken, ≈øhe took no comfort, in her child, though a man-child; ≈øhe regarded it not: <hi>For the glory is departed from I≈ørael, the Ark of God is taken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ≈øay not when the Ark of God is lo≈øt: but I ≈øay when it is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of lo≈øing: when the Go≈øpel is in danger, the Mini≈øters of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpel in danger, and the Ordinances in danger to be lo≈øt, then the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God have trembling hearts, and careful heads. When God threatned the <hi>I≈øraelites,</hi> that he would not go with them, they were troubled for the lo≈øs of Gods pre≈øence, and would not put on their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, <hi>Exod</hi> 33.3, 4. <hi>I will not go up in the mid≈øt of thee, for thou art a ≈øtiff-necked people, le≈øt I con≈øume thee in the way: And when the people

            <p>And there be four rea≈øons, why the people of God are ≈øo much troubled when the Ark of God is in danger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rea≈øon</hi> 1. Becau≈øe of the great love they bear to the Ark of God; <hi>As God loveth the gates of</hi> Sion, <hi>more than all the dwellings of</hi> Jacob, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 87.2. ≈øo the people of God love the Ordinances of God, and the faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters of Chri≈øt, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 26.8. <hi>Lord I have loved the habitation of thy hou≈øe, and the place where thine honour dwelleth,</hi> P≈øal. 27.4. <hi>One thing have I de≈øired of the Lord, that will I ≈øeek after, that I may dwell in the hou≈øe of the Lord all the dayes of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his Temple.</hi> Now love ≈øtirreth up the affections, as young <hi>Cre≈øus,</hi> though he were dumb, yet ≈øeeing his Father like to be killed, cryed out, <hi>Do not kill my Father.</hi> Such is the love of the Saints of God to the Ark, that they cannot be ≈øilent, they cannot but tremble when they ≈øee the Ark in danger. <hi>and for</hi> Sions <hi>≈øake, the cannot hold their peace: and they cannot be ≈øilent until the Lord make the righteous thereof go out like brightne≈øs, and the ≈øalvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The people of God are troubled at this, becau≈øe of the intere≈øt they have in the Ark of God: Now intere≈øt ≈øtirreth up affection, as when another mans hou≈øe is on fire: as you had a lamentable and ≈øad providence this la≈øt week, and it is not to be forgotten, how ≈øuddenly in all our fea≈øtings, may God da≈øh all our mirth. Now con≈øider, how were they affected that had an intere≈øt in tho≈øe that were burned: ≈øo the people of God have an intere≈øt in the Ark. God is the Haven of a child of God, the portion and inheritance of a child of God; and when God begins to for≈øake them, they cannot but be afflicted and troubled: The Ordinances of God are the Jewels
<pb facs="tcp:62760:239"/>of a Chri≈øtian, &amp; the Trea≈øure of a Chri≈øtian; and the lo≈øs of them cannot but trouble them: And Je≈øus Chri≈øt is the joy of a Chri≈øtian, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when Chri≈øt is departing, they cannot but be much afflicted at it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The people of God are much troubled when the <hi>Ark</hi> is in danger, becau≈øe of the mi≈øchiefs that comes upon a Nation when the Ark of God is lo≈øt: woe be to that Nation when the Ark is gone. The Heathens had the Image of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and they conceived, that as long as that Image was pre≈øented among them, they could never be wor≈øted, but be pre≈øerved; and the <hi>Romans</hi> had a Buckler, upon which they had a Tradition, that as long as that Buckler was pre≈øerved, <hi>Rome</hi> could not be taken. Shall I give a hint, and ≈øet it out a little in five particulars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>When the Ark of God is taken, then the ways of</hi> Sion <hi>mourn, and none come to the ≈øolemn A≈ø≈øemblies: it was the complaint of the Church,</hi> Lam. 1.4. <hi>that is matter of ≈øadne≈øs.</hi>

            <p n="4">4. The people of God mu≈øt needs tremble when the Ark is in danger, becau≈øe of their acce≈ø≈øarine≈øs to the lo≈øing of the Ark; &amp; this was that which made old <hi>Eli</hi> ≈øo much troubled, becau≈øe he knew it was for his ≈øin that God ≈øuffered the Ark to be taken: He knew that his not puni≈øhing his two ≈øons, was one cau≈øe of that great ≈ølaughter the people of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> met withal, and that made him tremble: There is no per≈øon here in this Congregation, but his heart will tell him, he hath contributed ≈øomething towards the lo≈øs of the Ark. None of us ≈øo holy but our con≈øciences mu≈øt accu≈øe us; we have done ≈øomething that might cau≈øe God to take the Ark from us: And therefore Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> that ble≈ø≈øed Martyr, ≈øaid in his Prayer, <hi>Lord it was, for my unthankfulne≈øs for the Go≈øpel, that brought in Popery in Queen</hi> Mary<hi>'s dayes: and my unfruitfulne≈øs under the Go≈øpel, that was the cau≈øe of the untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly death of King</hi> Edward <hi>the ≈øixth: and tho≈øe that fled in Queen</hi> Mary<hi>'s dayes, ≈øadly complained that they were the cau≈øe of Gods taking away the Go≈øpel from</hi> England. O beloved, it is for thy ≈øin and my ≈øin, that the Ark of God is in
<pb facs="tcp:62760:239"/>danger; and therefore the Lod gave us trembling ≈øolicitous hearts, what ≈øhall become of the Ark.</p>
            <p>I come now to Application.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øe</hi> 1. If this be the property of a true child of God, to be ≈øolicitous when the Ark of God is in danger, and to have ≈øuch a trembling heart for fear of the Ark, then this is a certain ≈øign there are but few that are the children of God in truth. O where is the man? and where is the woman that like old <hi>Eli</hi> ≈øits watching and trembling for fear of the Ark? And that will appear by the≈øe rea≈øons.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, in reference to the many ≈øins in this Nation; for let me tell you, there is not one ≈øin for which God ever took away the Ark from any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but it is to be found in <hi>England.</hi> Did the Church of <hi>Ephe≈øus</hi> lo≈øe the Candle≈øtick, becau≈øe they had lo≈øt their fir≈øt love? And have not we lo≈øt our fir≈øt love to the Go≈øpel, and to the Ordinances? And did the Church of <hi>Landicea</hi> lo≈øe the Candle≈øtick, becau≈øe of lukewarmne≈øs? and are not we lukewarm? Did the people of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> as here in the Text, lo≈øe the Ark, becau≈øe they abhorred the offerings of God? and do not you do ≈øo? are not the ≈øins of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> among≈øt us? the ≈øins of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the ≈øins of all other Nations about us? and can any man here before God this day, in this Congregation, that con≈øiders the great unthankfulne≈øs of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; the great prophanene≈øs &amp; wickedne≈øs of this Nation, but they may conclude the Ark is in danger, &amp; God may ju≈øtly take the Ark from us.</p>
            <p>I might tell you of the Drunkenne≈øs, Adultery, Covetou≈øne≈øs, Inju≈øtice, and Uncharitablene≈øs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that doth abound among us; and I might tell you of Sanctuary ≈øins, prophanation of Sabbath and Sacraments, our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulne≈øs, and unfruitfulne≈øs, and unworthy walking under the Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: and you of this place, God may very well take the Ark even from you; and indeed it was the great intere≈øt I had in you, the which while I live I ≈øhall ever own; and that great affection and re≈øpect I had to you, that I would not ≈øend you home this day without a Sermon, and let you go without a ble≈ø≈øing. Now can any of you in this Pari≈øh, and this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; can any of you ≈øay, God may not ju≈øtly take the Go≈øpel from you?</p>
            <p>Secondly, ≈øhall I add, the di≈øcontents and divi≈øions of a Nation, as Chri≈øt ≈øaith, <hi>A Nation divided again≈øt it ≈øelf cannot ≈øtand;</hi> but I leave the≈øe things to your con≈øiderations: I believe there is none here but will confe≈øs the Ark of God is in danger to be lo≈øt. But now where are our <hi>Eli's</hi> to ≈øit watching and trembling for fear of the Ark? Where is <hi>Phinehas</hi> his Wife, that would not be comforted, becau≈øe the Ark of God was taken? Where are our <hi>Mo≈øes?</hi> our <hi>Elijahs,</hi> our <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>riahs?</hi> Where are they that lay to heart
<pb facs="tcp:62760:240"/>the dangers of the Ark? you complain of Taxes, decay of Trading, of this civil burden, and that civil burden; but where is the man or the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that complains of this mi≈øery, the lo≈øs of the Ark; Mo≈øt of you are like <hi>Gallio,</hi> he cared not for the≈øe things; if it had been a civil matter, then he would have meddled with it; but for Religion, he cared not for that; every man is troubled about <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum,</hi> about civil concernments; but who layes to heart? who regards what ≈øhall become of Religion? There is a ≈øtrange kind of indifferency and lukewarmne≈øs upon mo≈øt peoples ≈øpirits; ≈øo they have their trading go on, and their civil burdens removed, they care not what becomes of the Ark.</p>
            <p>There is a Text of Scripture, I ≈øhall not ≈øpend much time in opening it, but I would have you well con≈øider it, <hi>Ho≈ø.</hi> 7.9. <hi>Strangers have devoured his ≈øtrength, and he knoweth it not: yea gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.</hi> Shall I ≈øay gray hairs are upon the Go≈øpel? I come not hither to Prophecy, I ≈øay not, the Go≈øpel is dying, but I ≈øay it hath gray hairs: for you have had the Go≈øpel a hundred years and above, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is in its old-age: and I dare challenge any Schollar to ≈øhew me an example of any Nation that hath enjoyed the Go≈øpel for a hundred years together. Now that gray hairs is to a hundred years, is no wonder: well, gray hairs are here and there, and yet no man layeth it to heart.</p>
            <p>Now ≈øhall I ≈øpend time to ≈øhew you what a great ≈øin it is not to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the danger that the Ark of God is in: con≈øider but three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Fir≈øt, it is a ≈øign you do not love the Go≈øpel: if you had any love to it, you would be troubled more for the danger of the Ark, than for any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward danger what≈øoever.</item>
               <item>Secondly, it is a ≈øign you have no intere≈øt in the Go≈øpel, for intere≈øt will ≈øtir up your affections: it is a ≈øign you are not concerned in the Go≈øpel, for if you were concerned in it, you would be affected with it, as tho≈øe that were intere≈ø≈øed in tho≈øe per≈øons that were in that lamentable fire the la≈øt week, it is impo≈ø≈øible but they ≈øhould be affected: and ≈øo it is a ≈øign you have no intere≈øt in God and Chri≈øt, if your hearts do not tremble for fear of the lo≈øs of the Ark.</item>
               <item>But thirdly, there is a cur≈øe of God pronounced again≈øt all tho≈øe that do not lay to heart the afflictions of <hi>Jo≈øeph,</hi> Amos 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Wo be to them that are at ea≈øe in</hi> Sion, <hi>and tru≈øt in the Mountain of</hi> Samaria: <hi>ye that put far away the evil day: that lie upon beds of Ivory, and ≈øtretch them≈øelves upon their Couches: that eat the Lambs out of the flock, and the Calves out of the mid≈øt of the ≈øtall: that chant to the ≈øound of the Viol, and invent to them≈øelves In≈øtruments of Mu≈øick: that drink wine in bowls, and annoint them≈øelves with

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øe</hi> 2. For exhortation, to be≈øeech you all, that God by a providence hath ≈øo unexpectedly brought this day to hear me, &amp; there may be a good providence in it; po≈ø≈øibly I may do good herein: I ≈øay let me be≈øeech you all to declare you are the people of God indeed and in truth, by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the example of old <hi>Eli,</hi> to be very ≈øolicious of the Ark of God, and let me exhort you to five particulars.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, let me per≈øwade you to believe, that the Go≈øpel is not entailed upon <hi>England; England</hi> hath no Letters Pattents of the Go≈øpel; the Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is removeable: God took away the Ark and for≈øook <hi>Shiloh,</hi> and he did not only take away the Ark, but the Temple al≈øo: he unchurched the <hi>Jews,</hi> he unchurched the ≈øeven Churches of <hi>A≈øia,</hi> and we know not how ≈øoon he may unchurch us: I know no warrant we have to think that we ≈øhall have the Go≈øpel another hundred years: God knows how to remove his Candle≈øtick, but not to de≈øtroy it: God doth often remove the Church, but doth not de≈øtroy it: God removed his Church out of the Ea≈øt, as the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches were famous Churches, but God removed them, and now the <hi>Turk</hi> over≈øpreads that Country.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I would per≈øwade you that <hi>Englands</hi> Ark is in danger to be lo≈øt: were it not only for the ≈øins of <hi>England,</hi> tho≈øe prodigious iniquities among≈øt us, and that ≈øtrange un-heard-of ingratitude that is in the Land: but I will ≈øay no more of that, becau≈øe I would ≈øpeak nothing but what becomes a ≈øober Mini≈øter of the Go≈øpel.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I would per≈øwade you, and O that I could rai≈øe you up to old <hi>Eli</hi>'s practice: <hi>He ≈øate watching, for his heart trembled for fear of the Ark:</hi> He had a thoughtful head and an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>aking heart, for the Ark of God that was in great danger: and that I might move you to this, con≈øider what a ≈øad condition we are in, if the Ark be taken: what will your E≈øtate do you good? or what will your concernments do you good if the Go≈øpel be gone? wherein doth <hi>England</hi> exceed other places? there is more wealth in <hi>Turkie</hi> than in <hi>England:</hi> And the Heathen Nations have more of the glory of the world, than any Chri≈øtian King hath: What is the glory of <hi>England?</hi> what is the glory of Chri≈øtianity but the Go≈øpel? if the Go≈øpel be gone, our glory is gone. Pray remember <hi>Eli</hi>'s Daughter-in-Law, the wife of <hi>Phinehas</hi> ≈øhe hearkned not though a man Child was born, and would receive no comfort, but called his name <hi>Ichabod:</hi> for the glory is departed from <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> The Ark of God is taken: O when the glory is gone, who would de≈øire to live? I am loth to tell
<pb facs="tcp:62760:241"/>you the ≈øtory of <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtome,</hi> he was but one man, yet when he was bani≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Con≈øtantinople,</hi> the people all petitioned for him, and ≈øaid, <hi>They could as well lo≈øe the Sun out of the Firmament, as lo≈øe</hi> Chry≈øo≈øtom <hi>from among them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, let me per≈øwade you not to mourn immoderately, neither be di≈øcouraged: I would willingly ≈øpeak ≈øomething to comfort you before I leave you, I know not by what ≈øtrange providence I came here this day, and the Lord knows when I ≈øhall ≈øpeak to you again: therefore I would not ≈øend you home comfortle≈øs: O therefore mourn not as without hope, for I have four Arguments to per≈øwade me, that the Ark of God will not be lo≈øt, though it be in danger of lo≈øing.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, becau≈øe God hath done great things already for this Nation; and I argue like <hi>Manoah</hi>'s Wi≈øe, ≈øurely if God had intended to de≈øtroy us, he would not have done that he hath done for us: He that hath done ≈øo much for us, will not now for≈øake us. And therefore though our hearts tremble, yet let them not ≈øink within us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I argue from the abundance of praying people that are in this Nation, there are many that night and day pray unto God, that the Ark may not be taken; and let me a≈ø≈øure you, God did never for≈øake a praying &amp; reforming people. When God intends to de≈øtroy a Nation, and take away the Ark, he takes away the Spirit of Prayer; but where God gives the Spirit of Prayer, there God will continue the Ark. You all know, that if there had been but ten good men in tho≈øe five Cities, God would have ≈øpared them: We have many hundreds that fear God in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that do not give God re≈øt, but night and day pray unto God for this Land: And who knows but for their ≈øakes God will ≈øpare the Ark.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, another ground of comfort is this, that God hath hitherto dealt with <hi>England,</hi> not by way of Rule, but by way of Prerogative; we have had un-churching ≈øins all the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and of King <hi>James;</hi> and the godly Mini≈øters have been threatned ruine from year to year; but God hath hitherto ≈øaved <hi>England</hi> by way of Prerogative; God hath ≈øpared us, becau≈øe he will ≈øpare us: according to that Text, <hi>I will be graci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>us, to whom I will be gracious.</hi> God will not be tyed to his own rule; and who knoweth but God will deliver us?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, another ground of comfort is, that God is now pouring out his Viols upon Antichri≈øt and all this ≈øhall end in the ruine of Antichri≈øt; God is pouring forth his Viols upon the Throne of the Bea≈øt, and all the≈øe tran≈øactions ≈øhall end in the ruine of Antichri≈øt: though ≈øome drops of the≈øe Viols may light upon the Reformed Churches, and they may ≈ømart <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> a while, and God may ≈øeverely puni≈øh them, yet it will be but for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while, but the Viols ≈øhall be poured out upon Antichri≈øt: God may
<pb facs="tcp:62760:241"/>≈øcourge all the Reformed Churches before the≈øe Viols be poured out, and per≈øecution may go through them all; the which I call drops of the≈øe Viols, but the Viols are intended for Antichri≈øt, and ≈øhall end in the time of Antichri≈øt: and what≈øoever becomes of us, yet our children, and our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens children, ≈øhall ≈øee the i≈ø≈øue of the Viols poured out upon the Whore of <hi>Babylon.</hi> This I ≈øpeak for your comfort.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, I am to exhort you, that you would all of you contribute your utmo≈øt endeavour, to keep the Ark of God from being taken: and here I ≈øhall ≈øhew you,

            <p>Fir≈øt, what the Magi≈øtrate ≈øhould do, I ≈øhall ≈øay but little of them, becau≈øe I am not now to ≈øpeak to them; they are to u≈øe their Authority for the ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling of the Ark: for the Ark of the Covenant will be like the Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> always floating upon the waters, until the Magi≈øtrates ≈øettle it. Thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.12. he gathered together all the cho≈øen men of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> thirty thou≈øand to fetch home the Ark. So <hi>Solomon,</hi> he a≈ø≈øembled the Elders of <hi>I≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and the heads of the Tribes, the Nobles, &amp; the chief of the Fathers of the children of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> to <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> with a great deal of pomp, to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord into its place. O that God would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage our Nobles &amp; Magi≈øtrates that they might be ≈øolicitous to ≈øettle the Ark: Magi≈øtrates mu≈øt not be as the <hi>Phili≈øtine,</hi> they had the Ark, but what did they with it? they ≈øet it up in the hou≈øe of <hi>Dagon,</hi> but <hi>Dagon</hi> and the Ark could never agree: where fal≈øe Religion comes in at one door, the true Religion goes out at the other; you mu≈øt not put the Ark and <hi>Dagon</hi> together.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what mu≈øt the Mini≈øters do to keep the Ark from lo≈øing? They mu≈øt endeavour after holine≈øs, the Ark wil never ≈øtand ≈øteddy, nor pro≈øper upon the ≈øhouldiers of <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>

<pb facs="tcp:62760:242"/>Text; they thought the very pre≈øence of the Ark would excu≈øe them, and keep them ≈øafe, and therefore they carried the Ark into the Camp: though they reformed not, and repented not, yet they thought the Ark would ≈øave them.</p>
            <p>So many there be that think the Ark will ≈øave them, though never ≈øo wicked: but nothing will ≈øecure a Nation but repentance &amp; reformation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Do not undervalue the Ark:</hi> this was <hi>Michal</hi>'s ≈øin, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.14, 15 16. <hi>When</hi> David <hi>danced before the Ark, and</hi> Michal <hi>mocked him, and de≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øed him in her heart:</hi> but ≈øaith he, <hi>it was before the Lord, and if this be vile, I will he more vile.</hi> Some men begin to ≈øay, what need we any preaching, will not reading prayers ≈øerve? Others ≈øay, what need ≈øo much preaching, will not once a day ≈øerve? Now this is to undervalue the Ark; therefore let us ≈øay as <hi>David,</hi> if to preach the word, if to fa≈øt and pray for the Nation, <hi>If this be vile, then I will be more vile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>We mu≈øt not pry into the Ark:</hi> this was the ≈øin of the men of <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øheme≈øh.</hi> 1 Sam. 6.19. <hi>They looked into the Ark and God ≈ømote them, and cut off fifty thou≈øand and three≈øcore men.</hi> Be not too curious in ≈øearching where God hath not di≈øcovered or revealed. For example, there be great thoughts of a heart, when God will deliver his people, and ≈øet his Churches at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; and many men talk much of the Year 1666. that ≈øhall be the year wherein Antichri≈øt ≈øhall be de≈øtroyed: And there are ≈øtrange impre≈ø≈øions upon the hearts of many learned men, as to this Year; ≈øome go to the Year 1669. and others pitch upon other times; but truly if you will have my judgment, and I am glad of this opportunity to tell you, <hi>This is to pry too much into the Ark:</hi> Remember the Text, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.17. <hi>It is not for you to know the Times or the Sea≈øons which the Father hath put in his own power.</hi> And thus to conclude upon any particular time, if you find you are deceived, it is the way to make you Athei≈øts, and that afterwards you ≈øhall believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: And tho≈øe Mini≈øters do no ≈øervice, or rather ill ≈øervice to the Church of God, that conclude of the Times and Sea≈øons.</p>
            <p>A Popi≈øh Author ≈øaith, that in the Year 1000. there was a general be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief over the Chri≈øtian World, that the day of Judgment ≈øhould be that Year; but when the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </epigraph>
            <p>IN this Chapter we have the ≈øum of a precious Sermon which our Saviour makes to his Di≈øciples in the pre≈øence of the multitude. In which we have,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Several cautions in the fir≈øt twenty ver≈øes of that Chapter.</item>
               <item>2. Some exhortations from thence to the end of it. The Cautions are the≈øe.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Fir≈øt, to beware of Hypocri≈øie, in the three fir≈øt ver≈øes, <hi>Beware of the Leaven of the Phari≈øees,</hi> which is hypocri≈øie; and the motive wherewith he backs this caution, is this, That all things ≈øhould be opened and made known hereafter, how clo≈øely ≈øoever they may be carryed, and how ≈øecretly ≈øoever their ≈øins may be committed here. Men may think to varni≈øh over the fowle≈øt of their actions by a fair and plau≈øible
<pb facs="tcp:62760:243"/>pretences, and ≈øo to hide their iniquities from the eyes of God and men; but they are much mi≈øtaken; for there is nothing <hi>covered that ≈øhall not be revealed, nor hid, that ≈øhall not be known,</hi> ver. 2.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He warns them to beware of timerou≈øne≈øs and fearfulne≈øs in publi≈øhing his Go≈øpel, from the beginning of the 4 to the 12. Ver≈øe, <hi>I ≈øay unto you, my friends, be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that they have no more that they can do; but I will forewarn you whom you ≈øhall fear, Fear him, who after he hath killed, hath power to ca≈øt into Hell. I ≈øay unto you, Fear him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, He cautions them to beware of covetou≈øne≈øs, and this caution of his was occa≈øioned by one that de≈øired Chri≈øt to ≈øpeak to his Brother to divide the inheritance with him, <hi>ver≈øe</hi> 13. Upon this Chri≈øt takes occa≈øion to caution them again≈øt covetou≈øne≈øs, <hi>ver≈øe</hi> 15. <hi>And he ≈øaid unto them, take heed and beware of covetou≈øne≈øs.</hi> And that he might ≈øet out the folly of this ≈øin of covetou≈øne≈øs, he doth elegantly ≈øet it forth by a Parable of a rich man, who was coveting after more and more of the world, and was ca≈øting, plodding, and contriving how to pull down his barns, and to build greater, and how to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe his E≈øtate in the world, when God ≈øaid unto him, <hi>Thou fool, this night ≈øhall thy ≈øoul be required of thee; and who≈øe then will the≈øe things be which thou ha≈øt provided?</hi> from <hi>ver.</hi> 15. to 20.</p>
            <p>Having given them the≈øe cautions, he proceeds to give them ≈øeveral exhortations, as to ≈øeeking after the Kingdom of God, to giving of alms, to watchfulne≈øs again≈øt the coming of Chri≈øt to Judgment, and ≈øeveral other duties which I ≈øhall not now in≈øi≈øt upon.</p>
            <p>The Text contains that exhortation of Chri≈øt, wherein he exhorts them to undauntedne≈øs and re≈øolution in the ways of God. <hi>Fear not little Flock, for it is your Fathers good plea≈øure to give you a Kingdom.</hi>

            <p>Before I come to the confirmation of this Truth, I ≈øhall ≈øhew how many ways a people or per≈øon may have God to be their Father, and they may be his Children.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Fir≈øt, A people or per≈øon may have God for their Father by Creation; as God is the great Creator of the World, and they are his Creatures, in this general ≈øence God is a Father to all the Men and Women in the World; to this refers that Scripture, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.10. ≈øaith the Prophet there, <hi>Have we not all one Father? Hath not one God created us?</hi> but it is a more peculiar ≈øon-≈øhip that belongs to Believers; they have <hi>God</hi> for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a more ≈øpecial and peculiar manner than this is.</item>
               <item>Secondly, A people or per≈øon may be the children of God, and God may be their Father by profe≈ø≈øion: Thus God was a Father to the Jewi≈øh Nation of old, becau≈øe they among all the Nations of the World did profe≈øs to own the Lord for their God, and to ≈øerve and wor≈øhip him; and in this re≈øpect God doth profe≈øs him≈øelf to be a Father to <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> Jer. 3 9. <hi>I am a Father to I≈ørael,</hi> ≈øaith God, <hi>Ephraim is my fir≈øt-born:</hi> And thus God is a Father to all tho≈øe that do profe≈øs his Name. But if this be all the claim that we can lay to God as our Father, that he is ≈øo to us, and that we are his children only by an external profe≈ø≈øion, this will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title
<pb facs="tcp:62760:244"/>us to the Kingdom, that eternal inheritance that God hath laid up for his people in the life to come; it is therefore yet in a more peculiar manner that Believers have God for their Father.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, A per≈øon may have God for his Father by adoption and regeneration; and thus true Believers, and only ≈øuch are the children of God, and God is their Father, 1 John 12.13. <hi>To as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the Sons of God, even to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on his name, which were born not of blood nor of the will of the fle≈øh, nor of the will of man, but of God:</hi> The≈øe are the ≈øons of God, the ≈øtricte≈øt and mo≈øt peculiar ≈øons that ≈øhall be made partakers of all the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the children of God, <hi>viz.</hi> tho≈øe that receive Chri≈øt into their hearts by faith, and ≈øuch as are truly regenerate and born again; the≈øe are the true and genuine children of the mo≈øt High, the heirs of God, and coheirs of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, as the expre≈ø≈øion is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. the≈øe are the children of whom it was ≈øpoken, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. la≈øt. <hi>I will be a Father unto you, and you ≈øhall be my ≈øons and daughters, ≈øaith the Lord Almighty.</hi> Having thus ≈øhewn unto you the ≈øeveral re≈øpects in which we may have God for our Father, I ≈øhall come to the confirmation of it, and ≈øhall prove that Believers have God for their Father in this ≈øpecial and peculiar manner; there are abundance of Scripture-proofs for this, in which Je≈øus Chri≈øt ≈øpeaking to his Di≈øciples, calleth God their Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Let your light ≈øo ≈øhine before men, that they ≈øeeing your good works, may glorifie your Father which is in Heaven.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 48. <hi>Be ye perfect as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect,</hi> Mat. 6.8. <hi>Your Father knoweth what things you have need of, before you ask them,</hi> Mat. 18.14. <hi>Even ≈øo it is not the will of your Father which is in Heaven, the≈øe little ones ≈øhould peri≈øh,</hi> Joh. 20.17. <hi>Go tell my brethren</hi> (≈øaith Chri≈øt) <hi>that I a≈øcend to my Father, and to your Father, to my God, and to your God.</hi> By the≈øe and other Scriptures we may ≈øee that God is ≈øet forth to Believers under the relation of a Father to them: And as God is called in Scripture a Believers Father, ≈øo they are called ≈øons, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Becau≈øe ye are ≈øons, God hath ≈øent forth the ≈øpirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba Father. Wherefore thou art no more a ≈øervant, but a ≈øon; and if a ≈øon, then an heir of God through Chri≈øt.</hi> Again, 1 Joh. 3.2. <hi>Now we are the Sons of God, but it doth not yet appear what we ≈øhall be; when we ≈øhall appear, we ≈øhall be like him; for we ≈øhall ≈øee him as he is, Gal.</hi> 3.16. The Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaking to the unbelieving <hi>Galatians,</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>We are all the Children of God by Faith, which is in Chri≈øt Je≈øus.</hi> I ≈øhall no longer in≈øi≈øt on the confirmation of this Doctrine, but ≈øhall come to the application of it.</item>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øe.</hi> Is it ≈øo, that all true believers are the children of God, and
<pb facs="tcp:62760:245"/>have God for their heavenly Father, then the fir≈øt u≈øe may be of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and con≈øolation to the godly, in that they are ≈øo nearly related to the great God; believers by virtue of their ≈øon-≈øhip, having God for their heavenly Father, have abundant ground of comfort and con≈øola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the≈øe ≈øeveral accounts.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, They are under his fatherly care and providence: fathers take care for their children, to provide them things nece≈ø≈øary, as meat, drink, and apparel; <hi>ab ii≈ødem alimur ex quibus generamur,</hi> is a true Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im; We are nouri≈øhed of tho≈øe of whom we are begotten; Fathers when their children ask bread, will not give them ≈øtones; nor when they ask fi≈øh, will they give them ≈øcorpions, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.9. He that provides not the≈øe things for his children, is wor≈øe than an Infidel, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. and hath God commanded this from Parents towards their children, and will not God much more provide for his children that are truly regenerate and born again, and that have his Image by faith engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on their ≈øouls? he would do it much more abundantly, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.11. <hi>If ye being evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more ≈øhall your Father which is in heaven give good things to tho≈øe that ask him?</hi> This then is one great priviledge that believers are made partakers of by vertue of this relation, having God for their heavenly Father; God will certainly provide good things for them, both for their being and well-being here and hereafter; and they may come to God as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with holy boldne≈øs of faith for all things that they ≈øhall ≈øtand in need of; God takes care for tho≈øe that are ≈øtrangers and enemies to him, and makes his rain to fall upon the unju≈øt, as well as upon the ju≈øt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.4, 5, <hi>He giveth them rain from heaven, ≈øilling their hearts with food and gladne≈øs,</hi> Acts 14.7. <hi>And will he not much rather feed his own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? he giveth food to all fle≈øh,</hi> P≈øal. 136.25. And will he not much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take care for his own children that are engrafted into him by faith, that do love and ≈øerve him: if God's bounty be largely exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to tho≈øe that are ≈øtrangers and enemies to him, even to tho≈øe that go on in ≈øin and wickedne≈øs, as many times it is, then certainly he will kill the farted Calf for his own children, as the Father of the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal did for his returning Son. Nay, in this the great God exceedeth earthly Parents, as far as Heaven is above the earth; for natural Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents they give good things to their children when they ask them; but God the Father of Spirits will do much more abundantly for his children, aboye what they are able to ask or think: the Petitions of God's children may be large, their de≈øires and thoughts larger than heir Petitions; for we are not always able to expre≈øs outwardly,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:245"/>what inwardly we de≈øire; but God will do more abundantly for his people beyond all the≈øe. Let us look into the Word of God, and we ≈øhall there ≈øee what noble provi≈øion he hath made for his people, what food, yea, angels food he hath provided for them; what a fea≈øt of fat things (I mean of ≈øpiritual dainties and delicates) he hath dre≈ø≈øed for them; <hi>for their bread, they ≈øhall have the bread of life, he that eateth thereof, ≈øhall never hunger,</hi> John 6.48. they ≈øhall have their fill of that hidden Manna laid up in the Sanctuary. We read of <hi>Benjamins</hi> Me≈ø≈øe <hi>Gen</hi> 4.3. la≈øt, <hi>That it was five times as much as any of his Brethren;</hi> but the children of God, their food that they ≈øhall have from their heavenly Father, ≈øhall be a thou≈øand times better, and more ≈øatisfactory than that which ≈øhall be given to the men of the World; they ≈øhall have their mea≈øures heaped up, pre≈ø≈øed down, and running over, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 34.10. <hi>The young Lyons ≈øhall lack and ≈øuffer hunger, but the children of God, tho≈øe that cry unto God their Father, ≈øhall want no good thing;</hi> but e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ≈øpiritual good things, they ≈øhall be ≈øure to have their fill of the≈øe, and ≈øhall be ≈øatisfied with them, even as with marrow and fatne≈øs; and for their drink, they ≈øhall have the heavenly Nectar, the water of Life, the bloud of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, the which who≈øoever drinketh, ≈øhall thir≈øt no more, <hi>John</hi> 4.14. they ≈øhall be abundantly ≈øatisfied with the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of his hou≈øe, he will make them drink of the River of his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures; for with God is the fountain of life, in his light they ≈øhall ≈øee light, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 38.8, 9. there is a River, the ≈øtreams whereof ≈øhall make glad the City of God, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 46.4. and his Children ≈øhall drink of this River of Water of life, clear as chry≈øtal, proceeding out of the throne of God, and the Lamb, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.1. it is for the≈øe e≈øpecially that God hath provided the ≈øpiritual milk of the Word, that they may grow thereby; they ≈øhall ≈øuck ≈øweetne≈øs out of the promi≈øes, tho≈øe rich brea≈øts of con≈øolation; and for their apparel, the Children of God may ≈øay as the Prophet, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 61.10. <hi>I will greatly rejoyce in the Lord, my ≈øoul ≈øhall be joyful in my God; for he hath cloathed me with the garments of ≈øalvation; he hath, covered me with a robe of righteou≈øne≈øs, as a bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom decketh him≈øelf with Ornaments, and as a Bride adorneth her ≈øelf with Jewels.</hi> What ≈øhall I ≈øay? they ≈øhall be cloathed with the righteou≈øne≈øs of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, a garment without ≈øpot or blemi≈øh, white as ≈ønow, even <hi>Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of tho≈øe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you have the fir≈øt ground of con≈øolation to Believers, upon the account of having God for their Father, he will certainly provide for them tho≈øe things that ≈øhall be nece≈ø≈øary, both in this life, and in the life to come.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:246"/>Secondly, Is God a Father to Believers? then another ground of con≈øolation is this, That he will defend them from their enemies: How mightily doth it provoke natural Parents to ≈øee their Children abu≈øed? How quickly will their eye affect their heart, and ≈øtir them up to come in and re≈øcue them? So will the Lord do for tho≈øe that are his children by Adoption and Regeneration; he will defend them, he will be a wall of fire round about them, ≈øo that all their enemies, both ≈øpiritual and temporal, ≈øhall not be able to do them any real hurt: the Devil, and all his wiles and temptations, the World and all its tempting allurements: yea, all the policy and malice of Earth and Hell, ≈øhall not be able to work their ruine; the Lord is on their their ≈øide, and they have more for them, than they have again≈øt them. Upon this con≈øideration it was that <hi>David</hi> tells us in his Book of <hi>P≈øalms, Though I walk</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>in the valley of the ≈øhadow of death, yet will I fear none ill; for thou, O Lord, art my Rock and my Fortre≈øs, and my ≈øalvation eke for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Would we not account him unworthy the name of a Father, that would ≈øuffer his Children to be beaten and abu≈øed, and de≈øtroyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his face, and not act in their defence? and will God ≈øuffer his dear Children ≈øo to be? No certainly, <hi>He that toucheth them, toucheth the apple of his eye, Zach.</hi> 2.8. and God accounts what is done to them, as if it were done to him≈øelf in per≈øon; <hi>In as much as ye did it unto tho≈øe little ones, ye did it unto me:</hi> Will Chri≈øt ≈øay one day as he tells us? <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.40. and, <hi>in as much as ye did it not unto the lea≈øt of the≈øe my brethren, ye did it not unto me,</hi> ver. 45. Beloved, there is a time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the great God will reckon with ungodly men, for all the injuries and wrongs which they have done to his people, as if they were done to him≈øelf immediately.</p>
            <p>Oh! con≈øider of this you that are true Believers; are you invironed round with adver≈øaries, either ≈øpiritual or temporal? you have God for your defence, a God infinite in power, which is able to defend you from the harde≈øt a≈ø≈øaults of your mo≈øt potent and politick Enemies; his Name is a ≈øtrong Tower, the Righteous fly unto it, and are ≈øafe. Are you encountring with great temptations? The Lord being your Father, he will protect you, and not ≈øuffer you to be tempted above what you are able to bear, but together with temptation, will make way for your e≈øcape, that you may be able to bear it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.30. the Lord knoweth that his Children are liable to many temptations from Satan, from the world, and from their own corruptions, and that they are ≈øubject to many afflictions and tribulations from the hands
<pb facs="tcp:62760:246"/>of men, and therefore he will be ≈øure to be with them, and to be a very pre≈øent help to them in the time of trouble.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Is God a Believers Heavenly Father? then there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for them, that God will pity them and compa≈ø≈øionate them in all their afflictions; a tender Father pitieth his Children when they are in any calamity; as for in≈øtance, in ≈øickne≈øs how will the groans of a Child go near the heart of a loving Parent? How do the Agonies of pain in the Child, cau≈øe grief and ≈øorrow in the Parents heart? What means would not a Parent u≈øe to procure the health and ea≈øe of a Child? <hi>My life is bound up in the life of the Lad,</hi> ≈øays <hi>Jacob</hi> concerning <hi>Benjamin. Oh Ab≈øalon, my ≈øon, my ≈øon, would God I had dyed for thee,</hi> ≈øays <hi>David</hi> concerning <hi>Ab≈øalon.</hi> What ≈øympathyzing and ≈øellow-feeling will a dear and tender Parent have of the mi≈øeries of his Children? And as a Father pitieth his Children, ≈øo the Lord pitieth them that fear him, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 103.13. The Lord is very pitiful, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.11. The pity and compa≈ø≈øion of the Lord towards his Children, is excellently ≈øet forth in that Scripture, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.20. Is <hi>Ephraim</hi> my dear ≈øon? Is he a plea≈øant Child? I ≈øpeak again≈øt him, I do earne≈øtly remember him ≈øtill; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my bowels are troubled for him; I will ≈øurely have mercy on him, ≈øaith the Lord; The bowels of the Lord do exceedingly yearn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his people in all their afflictions and di≈øtre≈ø≈øes, and he is full of pity and compa≈ø≈øion towards them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Is God a Father to all true Believers? then here is al≈øo for their comfort, that God doth, and always will love them, and take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in them; He loves them with an everla≈øting love, they are his cho≈øen Jewels, and he will certainly one day poli≈øh them, though he ≈øuffer them to be among the rubbi≈øh of the World for a while; They are his plea≈øant pictures, and he delights to be looking on them, the eyes of the Lord are upon them that fear him, and upon them that hope in his mercy, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 33.18. God takes plea≈øure to be viewing the new creature which he hath framed by his own Spirit in the hearts of his people, and his own Image which he ≈øtamped upon them; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the love that the Lord beareth his Children, infinitely exceeds the Love that earthly Parents bear to theirs, in that he loveth them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually: Earthly Parents they love their Children, but their love may be withdrawn from them again, and is often times; but the love of God will never be withdrawn from his love; whom the Lord loveth, he loveth to the end; and although his loving countenance may be eclip≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a time, and they may lo≈øe the ≈øence of his love to them, by their failings &amp; ≈øinful infirmities, yet the Lord loves them ≈øtill; <hi>There is nothing
<pb facs="tcp:62760:247"/>≈øhall be able to ≈øeparate Believers from the love of God,</hi> Rom. 8.25. and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul</hi> putteth the que≈øtion there, (≈øaith he) <hi>Who ≈øhall ≈øeparate us from the love of God? Shall tribulation, or di≈øtre≈øs, or per≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, or famine, or nakedne≈øs, or peril, or ≈øword, as it is written. For thy ≈øake are we killed all the day long, we are accounted as ≈øheep for the ≈ølaughter: Nay,</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>in all the≈øe things we are more than Conquerors through him that loved us; for I am per≈øwaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, nor powers, nor things pre≈øent, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature ≈øhall be able to ≈øeparate us from the love of God, which is in Chri≈øt Je≈øus our Lord.</hi> It is not all the troubles of the world, nor tribulations, nor any thing that can render Believers le≈øs lovely in the eyes of Chri≈øt: It is not all the Devils in Hell, that can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw Gods love from his children, although they do endeavour<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> it by enticing them to ≈øin by their temptations, and then by accu≈øing them to God for ≈øin; yet all this will not rout them out of God's love: though the Devil do labour to pick a quarrel between God and his people; yet it is not principalities nor powers, it is not all the power of Hell that ≈øhall be able to withdraw Gods love from them.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Is God a Father to Believers? Then they may take this for their comfort, that he will continually be mindful of them. Parents do remember their Children, and are mindful of them: ≈øo the Lord, he remembreth his people and will never forget them, I≈øa. 49.15. <hi>Can a Woman forget her ≈øucking child, that ≈øhe ≈øhould not have compa≈ø≈øion on the Son of her womb; yea, they may, yet I will not forget thee:</hi> Earthly Parents, though it be but rare, yet they may, and ≈øometimes do forget their children; but God, he is more tender and mindful of his Children, than earthly Parents are of theirs; <hi>yea, they may, yet will not I forget thee,</hi> &amp;c. Though Gods people do too often forget him, yet he doth never forget them, but remember them in all their conditions, even in their low e≈øtate, God is mindful of them, P≈øal. 136.23. <hi>Who remembred us in our low e≈øtate, for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>La≈øtly, Is God a Father to Believers? Then they may take this for their comfort, that God will provide an inheritance for them hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Fathers provide portions and inheritances for their Children for hereafter, ≈øo doth God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Now ≈øaith the Apo≈øtle, <hi>We are the Sons of God; and if ≈øons, then heirs, heirs of God, and coheirs with Je≈øus Chri≈øt:</hi> How often is the Kingdom of Heaven called an inheritance, the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of the Saints, or them that are ≈øanctified, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.32. and 26.8. There is an eternal inheritance laid up for the Children of God for hereafter; yea, the Kingdom of Heaven is their inheritance, and
<pb facs="tcp:62760:247"/>it is now preparing for them, <hi>John</hi> 14.2. and they ≈øhall have a≈ø≈øuredly one day an abundant entrance into their Fathers Kingdom; the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God while they are in the World, they are as Heirs in their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority, they have not yet the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of their inheritances, but it is theirs, and they ≈øhall have it in rever≈øion; but hereafter when they ≈øhall leave this earthly Tabernacle, then they ≈øhall have the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of it. Every true and ≈øincere Believer, he is an Heir to a Crown, even a Crown of glory that fadeth not away; <hi>Their lines are fallen to them in a plea≈øant place, they have a goodly Heritage; the Lord is the portion of their Inheritance, P≈øal.</hi> 16.5, 6. It is the hope of this Inheritance of theirs, that carrieth on the ≈øouls of the Saints in the whole cour≈øe of their lives; and maketh them joyfully and willingly to wade through all their troubles and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that they meet with in their way to Heaven. It is the con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this their portion and inheritance which they are entailed to by having God for their Father, that makes them forget the things that are behind, and pre≈øs forward towards the mark for the price of the high calling which is in Je≈øus Chri≈øt; it is their acting faith upon this, and having an eye to the recompence of reward, that makes them run with patience the race that is ≈øet before them: as knowing, that when they have fini≈øhed their cour≈øe, they ≈øhall receive a Crown of Life, which the Lord the Righteous Judge ≈øhall give them at that day.</p>
            <p>Here the godly have the earne≈øt of their inheritance, which is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.14. <hi>After that ye believed, ye were ≈øealed with the holy Spirit of Promi≈øe, which is the earne≈øt of our Inheritance, until the redemption of the purcha≈øed po≈ø≈ø<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>≈ø≈øion, unto the prai≈øe of his Glory.</hi> Here Believers have the promi≈øe of their inheritance: The Word of God is a Believers Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for his inheritance, in which God doth as it were by promi≈øe make over Heaven, and Happine≈øs, and Glory to true Believers, to be enjoyed by them for ever in the Life to come; but hereafter, then they ≈øhall have the fruition and po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of it.</p>
            <p>Would you know what a glorious Inheritance this is, that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God by believing are entitled to? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>It is an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance uncorruptible, undefiled, which fadeth not away.</hi> They are Heirs to a Crown of Glory, the are heirs of God, and coheirs with Je≈øus Chri≈øt, which is the Heir of all things: believe it Friends, it is ≈øuch a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious inheritance that the Children of God are entitled unto, that all the Inheritances and Poffe≈ø≈øions in the world are but a trifle in compari≈øon of it; to ≈øet out the beauty and excellency of the Saints inheritance, is a task fitter for ≈øome Angel, than for a mortal Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="tcp:62760:248"/>
               <hi>For eye hath not ≈øeen, neither hath ear heard, neither hath entred into the heart of man to conceive what the Lord hath laid up for them that fear him,</hi> I≈øa. 64.4.</p>
            <p>Thus you ≈øee what abundant cau≈øe of comfort Believers have upon this con≈øideration, that God is their Father, and that they are his children in every condition of their lives, in every trouble either outward or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; how≈øoever it be with a regenerate Chri≈øtian, one that is a true child of God, he hath cau≈øe to take comfort in this.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Is a Believer in want here in the World? is he in di≈øtre≈øs, and driven to ≈øtreights, not knowing what cour≈øe to take for the ≈øupplying of his natural want<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

God which is the Believers Father, knows what things they need, and he is ready to hear them, and knoweth how to help them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Is a Believer in danger? is he inviron'd about with his Enemies on every ≈øide, and compa≈ø≈øed about with tho≈øe that ≈øeek his hurt? Oh! what comfort is this that he can go to God as unto a Father for help, even to him that is Almighty, and able in a moment to defend them from their mo≈øt powerful and politick adver≈øaries? is a godly man in danger, and hath he Enemies that do wrongfully ≈øeek his life, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had? <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 31.13. yet he may have the ≈øame confidence that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had in that condition, and ≈øay as he ≈øaid in the follownig Ver≈øe: <hi>Yet I tru≈øt in thee, Oh Lord, I ≈øaid, thou art my God, my times are in thy hand, deliver me from the hand of mine Enemies, and from them that per≈øecute me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Doth a Believer finde his corruption within, to rebel again≈øt the regenerate part? Doth he finde the Law in his Members which is warring again≈øt the Law of his minde, to lead him into captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Law of ≈øin and death?

Oh! how little do thou≈øands think of this, whether they are the Children of God, and have God for their Father, or no; they care not for it, they make not out after it: Or take it for granted, when they have no true and real ground ≈øo to do.

The nearer the Relation is that the ≈øoul beareth to God, the greater is the aggravation of the ≈øin again≈øt God.</item>
               <item>Secondly, Labour to ≈øhew forth your noble extraction, by your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and rai≈øed affections; it is beneath the ≈øon of a Prince to be taken up with trifles, it is beneath one that is heir to a Kingdom, to ≈øet his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions upon low and ba≈øe things, things of nought; So it is beneath the Children of the great King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, to let their affections run out inordinately after the world, and the enjoyments thereof; they are born from above, and therefore ≈øhould ≈øet their affections upon things above, and not on things on earth, <hi>Colo≈ø.</hi> 3.2. What an un≈øutable thing is it for a Chri≈øtian, to be taken up with the inordinate love of the world? it is a Degradation to the heirs of Heaven to have their minds taken up only or mo≈øtly with Earth, and earthly Vanities, they are, <hi>ad majora nati,</hi> born to greater things: it is unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming ≈øuch to ≈øoil their affections with Earth, which are born to an inheritance incorruptible, which fadeth not away.

               <item>Thirdly, Labor to imitate your heavenly Father: <hi>Be you followers of God as dear Children,</hi> Ephe≈ø. 5.1. <hi>Be ye mercifull as your heavenly Father is merciful; be ye holy as he is holy, be ye compa≈ø≈øionate as he is in all things;</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to imitate your Heavenly Father, it is a Chri≈øtians honor to be like God, and to imitate him.</item>
               <item>Fourthly, Labour more and more to obey your heavenly Father: our natural Parents, may require obedience of us, and it is our duty to give it them; much more may him that is the Father of ≈øpirits require it of us, and it is much more our duty to give it him: <hi>Walk as obedient Children,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.14 Yea, you mu≈øt obey him chearfully too; The obedience of Children is herein differenced from the obedience of ≈ølaves, in that ≈ølaves are drawn to their duty out of a ≈ølavi≈øh fear,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:251"/>but children come to it willingly, out of a fillial affection. Oh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let your obedience to God be chearful and voluntary: Take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to do the will of your heavenly Father.</item>
               <item>La≈øtly, Submit to your heavenly Fathers cha≈øti≈øements; this is the Exhortation of the Apo≈øtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Heb. 12.5, 6, 7. <hi>My Son, de≈øpi≈øe not thou the cha≈øtening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of him. For whom the Lord loveth, be cha≈øteneth, and ≈øcourgeth every Son he receiveth. If ye endure cha≈øtening, God dealeth with you as with Sons, for what Son is he whom the Father cha≈øteneth not: But if ye are without cha≈øti≈øement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye Bollards and not Sons:</hi> Let us not then murmur and faint under our afflictions and cha≈øti≈øements, but let us ≈øubmit to them, and labour to grow the better for them. Thus much for the fir≈øt Ob≈øervation? That God is a believers heavenly Father; the other ob≈øervation that I propo≈øed to in≈øi≈øt upon from this Text, was the la≈øt of the five mentioned in the beginning, and it contains the chief ≈øum and ≈øcope of the whole ver≈øe, and is mo≈øt ≈øuitable to our Times, and to this Occa≈øion, you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member was this.</item>

               <item>Secondly, It is ≈øuppo≈øed in the Doctrine, that believers are like to meet with oppo≈øition from the world; they are diligent in the practi≈øe of godline≈øs, are driving a Trade for Heaven: they ≈øhall be ≈øure to meet with abundance of trouble and hindrance from the world, and the Prince of the world; this is a truth exceeding manife≈øt, both from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and experience: <hi>We ≈øhall be hated of all men for his names ≈øake, Mat.</hi> 10.22. And becau≈øe Chri≈øt hath cho≈øen his people out of the world, <hi>therefore the world hated him. Jo.</hi> 15.19. And experience makes this evidence in all ages of the world; tho≈øe that are godly &amp; walk with God, they have been ≈øure to have their portion of afflictions and tribulations, from the hands and tongues of the malicious and ungodly world, &amp; my de≈øign is to ≈øhew,

                     <item>Fir≈øt, I ≈øhall ≈øhew you by ≈øome in≈øtances from the word of God, how the Saints that have had an intere≈øt in the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Heaven, have <hi>been</hi> incouraged in the ways of God, and have had their ≈øpirits born up in their lowe≈øt <hi>condition,</hi> and in their greate≈øt <hi>tryals</hi> and <hi>troubles</hi> here below.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, I ≈øhall ≈øhew you that believers are dehorted from di≈øpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency; and being di≈ømayed under their ≈øufferings upon the con≈øideration of their Heavenly intere≈øt.</item>
                     <item>Thirdly, I ≈øhall give you ≈øome Rea≈øons, why believers, that have a Title to the Heavenly Glory, ≈øhould be couragious and undaunted, and not di≈ømayed at all their eternal Trials and Tribulations that they meet withal from the world: and ≈øo ≈øhall come to the Application.</item>

            <p>Fir≈øt, For the fir≈øt of the≈øe, I might give you many in≈øtances from the word of God, of the courage and magnanimity of the heirs of Heaven in their Tryals; as <hi>David,</hi> how couragious was he in the Lord, even in his lowe≈øt condition, <hi>P≈øalm.</hi> 46.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>God is our re≈øuge and our ≈øtrength, a very pre≈øent help in Trouble; therefore</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>will we not fear, though the earth be removed, though the Mountains be ca≈øt into the mid≈øt of the Sea, though the Waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the Mountains ≈øhake with the ≈øwelling thereof,</hi> Selah, <hi>P≈øalm.</hi> 118.6. <hi>The Lord is on my ≈øide, I will not fear what man can do unto me: David</hi> he had put confidence in God, and therefore was not afraid of man; where the fear of God is, and <hi>where</hi> the hope of glory is, there the ≈ølavi≈øh fear of man will quickly vani≈øh away: this no doubt was that which made the three Children not to be afraid of the fiery Furnace, nor <hi>Daniel</hi> of the Den of Lyons, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.16. and 6. We have a notable example to this purpo≈øe, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>Although the Fig-tree ≈øhould not blo≈ø≈øome, nor fruit be in the Vine; though the labour of the Olive ≈øhould fail, and the fields ≈øhould yield no meat, though the flocks ≈øhould be out off from the fold, and there ≈øhould be no herd in the ≈øtall: yet will I rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ≈øalvation.</hi> The con≈øideration of his heavenly intere≈øt, and that God, was the God of his ≈øalvation, was that which not only kept the Prophet from being di≈ømayed, but al≈øo made him to rejoyce in the ab≈øence of all creature joys and comforts; the want of the≈øe worldly things, were not able to abate his heavenly joy, which he had in the God of his ≈øalvation. The con≈øideration of
<pb facs="tcp:62760:252"/>their heavenly intere≈øt, and their title to the everla≈øting glory, was that which made the Apo≈øtles of Chri≈øt ≈øo <hi>couragious</hi> and <hi>comfortable</hi> under all their ≈øufferings that they underwent for Chri≈øt: This was that which made the Martyr <hi>Steven</hi> ≈øo fearle≈øs and undaunted, when he was on the brink of death, and when the ≈øtones flew about his ears, when he could <hi>look</hi> up into Heaven, the place of his Inheritance, where he was going, and take a view of that Heavenly glory, <hi>Acts</hi> 7<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> 55. A believer that can look up by an eye of faith upon Chri≈øt and Heaven and take a view of the un≈øeen world, the place of his eternal re≈øt and felicity, will be able in ≈øome mea≈øure to undergo with comfort, the ≈øharpe≈øt and bittere≈øt per≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions that the malice of Men or Divels can expo≈øe him to; This was that which made <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas</hi> ≈øing prai≈øes at midnight, when they were ≈øhut up in pri≈øon, and their feet in the ≈øtocks, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.25. This was that which cau≈øed the believing <hi>Hebrews, to take joyfully the ≈øpoiling of their goods;</hi> even the con≈øideration of their intere≈øt in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. <hi>For ye bad compa≈ø≈øion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the ≈øpoiling of your goods, knowing that in Heaven, you have a better, and a more enduring ≈øub≈øtance;</hi> Their knowledge of this their intere≈øt in the Heavenly riches, made them willingly to part with the earthly riches for the ≈øake of Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The next thing to be ≈øpoken unto, is this; to ≈øhew that the people of God, upon this con≈øideration of their intere≈øt in the Kingdom of Glory; have been dehorted from fear and di≈øpondence, and exhorted to courage and magnanimity in the ways of God: Upon this con≈øiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is, that Chri≈øt exhorts his little flock in the Text, not to fear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe that God would give them the Kingdom of Heaven. How often are the Servants of God in Scripture, dehorted from fear, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 41.10. <hi>Fear not, I am with thee, be not di≈ømaied, I am thy God.</hi> Ver≈ø. 14. <hi>Fear not thou worm</hi> Jacob, <hi>and ye men of</hi> I≈ørael: <hi>I will help thee ≈øaith the Lord thy Redeemer.</hi> I≈øa. 50.7, 8. <hi>Fear ye not the reproach of men, be not di≈ømayed at their revilings, for the Moth ≈øhall eat them up like a garment, and the worm ≈øhall eat them like wool, but my Righteou≈øne≈øs ≈øhall be for ever, and my Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from Generation to Generation:</hi> And again, Ver≈ø 12. <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:62760:252"/>for righteou≈øne≈øs ≈øake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven. Ble≈ø≈øed are ye when men ≈øhall revile you and per≈øecute you, and ≈øpeak all manner of evil again≈øt you fal≈øly for my ≈øake: rejoyce and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in Heaven.</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi> 6.22. <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed are ye when men ≈øhall hate you, and when they ≈øhall ≈øeparate from you their company, and ≈øhall reproach you, and ca≈øt out your name as evil for the Son of mans ≈øake, rejoyce in that day, and leap for joy, for behold your reward is great in Heaven.</hi> The con≈øideration of our intere≈øt in the Kingdom of Heaven, ≈øhould keep us from being di≈ømaved, though we are hated, per≈øecuted, reproached by the prophane world, but ≈øhould make us rejoyce rather, and leap for joy. Thus much for the ≈øecond thing, which is, That the people of God are dehorted from fear and di≈øpondency, and exhorted to courage and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity in the ways of God, from the very con≈øideration of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt in the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I ≈øhall give you the Rea≈øons why Believers, tho≈øe that have an intere≈øt in the Kingdom of Heaven, ≈øhould not fear not be di≈ømayed at any outward trouble, oppo≈øition, or tribulation that they meet with in the world.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, It is very un≈øutable for one that hath ≈øecured the heavenly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øt, and his title to eternal glory, to be <hi>di≈ømayed</hi> at thing of <hi>nought:</hi> how un≈øutable is it for one that is an Heir of Heaven, to be exce≈ø≈øively grieved and di≈øcon≈øolate, becau≈øe he meeteth with ≈øome rubs in his way thither?

            <p>For a worldling that hath all his good things here, and hath no other portion but in this life, to be grieved and perplexed at his <hi>external lo≈ø≈øes</hi> and <hi>troubles;</hi> this is not ≈øo much for ≈øuch a one to be grieved when he is thwarted in his de≈øigns, and when the world <hi>falls a cro≈øs to him,</hi> this is but ≈øutable and agreeable to <hi>≈øuch a one,</hi> becau≈øe he hath placed his Hope, his Contentment, his joy and delight in the≈øe things: and therefore being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of them, he is deprived of his be≈øt things, his Portion, his All.</p>
            <p>But for a <hi>Child of God,</hi> one that hath an intere≈øt in eternal life and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to be ca≈øt down and di≈ømayed at <hi>≈øuch ≈ømall things,</hi> as the affliction, trials
<pb facs="tcp:62760:253"/>and tribulations of the world: Oh what an un≈øeemly thing is this, as if their Heavenly intere≈øt did not give them greater cau≈øe of joy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, then tho≈øe external worldly afflictions, do give them cau≈øe of ≈øadne≈øs and di≈øcon≈øolation.</p>
            <p>The Frantick mirth of the prophane World, that are in the high way to Damnation, and the groundle≈øs perplexities of the regenerate Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, are both alike, un≈øuitable and un≈øeemly, although not both alike dangerous.</p>
            <p>To ≈øee a Worldling, that hath nothing el≈øe to comfort and ≈øupport him, but the fading enjoyments of this pre≈øent life, to be merry and jovial, as if all were well; and on the other hand, to ≈øee a believer that is an heir of Heaven, to live in a drooping and di≈øcon≈øolate ≈øtate, becau≈øe of the≈øe outward troubles, is cau≈øe of pity and lamentation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As it is un≈øuitable for a child of God that hath ≈øecured his eternal ≈øtate, and made ≈øure of his heavenly intere≈øt, to be di≈ømayed at the afflictions of the world, ≈øo it is very unwarrantble; believers are commanded to be much in holy rejoycing; <hi>Rejoyce</hi> (≈øaith Chri≈øt to his Di≈øciples) <hi>becau≈øe your names are written in Heaven,</hi> Luke 10.20. <hi>Be glad in the Lord, Oh ye righteous, and ≈øhout for joy, all ye upright in heart,</hi> P≈øal. 32.11. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord, oh ye righteous, for prai≈øe is comely for the upright,</hi> P≈øal. 33.1. <hi>Rejoyce evermore,</hi> 1 The≈ø. 5.16. Oh how exceeding unwarrantable is it then for tho≈øe that have an intere≈øt in the heavenly Glory, to be di≈øcouraged at their outward afflictions, by which they do di≈øparage Religion, and frighten away others from the doors of grace.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is irrational for one that hath ≈øecured his intere≈øt in the Heavenly Kingdom, to be afraid of his worldly afflictions and tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ≈øeeing all the lo≈ø≈øes and cro≈ø≈øes in the World, are as nothing comparatively to ≈øuch an one: Let a Child of God but weigh and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ≈øuch things aright, and compare the cau≈øe of joy that he hath, by virtue of his heavenly intere≈øt on the one hand, with the cau≈øe of ≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that he hath, by rea≈øon of the cro≈ø≈øes of the world on the other, and he will ≈øee, that he hath a thou≈øand times more cau≈øe of joy, than of ≈øorrow; and therefore the thoughts of his heavenly intere≈øt, ≈øhould ≈øwallow up tho≈øe of his worldly troubles and di≈øappointments. <hi>I reckon</hi> (≈øaith the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>that the ≈øufferings of this pre≈øent time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that ≈øhall be revealed in us,</hi> Rom. 1.18. And the ≈øame Apo≈øtle tell us el≈øewhere, <hi>Our light afflictions which are but for a moment, work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. Now, is it not unrea≈øonable for a believer to be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb facs="tcp:62760:253"/>and di≈øquieted with tho≈øe light afflictions which ≈øhall be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced with an eternal weight of glory? What can a child of God lo≈øe, as long as his God, his portion, his intere≈øt in Heaven is ≈øafe and ≈øecured to him? What are all the lo≈ø≈øes that he can ≈øu≈øtain in the World, as long as he is intere≈øted in the Eternal Kingdom of Glory?</p>
            <p>I mu≈øt tell you, Believers, ye that walk holily and clo≈øely with God, and have a title to the Kingdom of Heaven, for you to be grieved and di≈øcontented becau≈øe all things do not concur according to your de≈øires in the World, is unrea≈øonable and ab≈øurd; as if a rich man that hath a great E≈øtate, and fair Hou≈øes and Orchards, ≈øhould be di≈øquieted becau≈øe the winde bloweth away a few leaves from his Trees.</p>
            <p>Is not the Kingdom of Heaven that thou art entitled to, enough to make thee amends for all thy troubles and calamities in the end? Art thou troubled by the profane World, and vexed up and down by thy Enemies, and not ≈øuffered to re≈øt in quiet? And is it not enough for thee that the Kingdom of Heaven is the place of thine eternal re≈øt and happine≈øs, where thou ≈øhalt be for ever advanced above their reach? Art thou expo≈øed to the lo≈øs of thy place and e≈øtate in the World, and will not an incorrupted Crown of glory, and an eternal inheritance among them that are ≈øanctified, make thee amends for tho≈øe petty lo≈ø≈øes that thou ≈øu≈øtaine≈øt here? Art thou the off-≈øcouring of the World here? and is it not enough that thou ≈øhalt be glorified in the pre≈øence of Saints and Angels hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Art thou ≈ølandered and reproached by the World? And is not this enough to ≈øupport thee that thou ≈øhalt be acquitted at the bar of Chri≈øt? Do≈øt thou ≈øuffer the lo≈øs of liberty? And art thou un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der re≈øtraint and impri≈øonment, and is not this enough to comfort thee, that thou art free from the captivity and dominion of ≈øinne? and art rid of tho≈øe chains and fetters by which ≈øo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øands in the World are led captive by Satan at his plea≈øure, and that thou art free from the pri≈øon of Hell? Put ca≈øe (which is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt trouble that a godly man can undergoe in the World) thou art to lo≈øe thy life for the ≈øake of Chri≈øt, and of a good Con≈øcience, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a Believers intere≈øt in the Kingdom of Heaven ≈øhould keep him from being di≈ømayed at that lo≈øs; an eternal life of happine≈øs and glory will be enough to recompence thee a thou≈øand fold for lo≈ø≈øe of this frail life. Thus you have the third Rea≈øon, it is irrational for a Believer that hath an intere≈øt in the Kingdom of Heaven, to
<pb facs="tcp:62760:254"/>be di≈ømayed at tho≈øe outward cro≈ø≈øes and lo≈ø≈øes that he ≈øu≈øtains in the World, becau≈øe they are very little and incon≈øiderable while their God, their portion, their heavenly intere≈øts is ≈øafe and ≈øecure to them.</p>
            <p>La≈øtly, One that is an Heir of Heaven, and hath a title to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdom, ≈øhould be couragious in the ways of God, and not be daunted at his outward troubles, becau≈øe of the ≈øhort continuance of them, as the joyes and plea≈øures of the World are but for a little moment of time, ≈øo the ≈øorrows and tribulations of the World are but for a ≈ømall moment of time; neither the troubles of the godly, though they may be ≈øharp, yet they are but ≈øhort, death will quickly put a period to them all, all the tryals and tribulations of the Saints will be at an end when they come to enter into their everla≈øting re≈øt. The Saints in Heaven are perfectly freed as from the evil of ≈øin, ≈øo from the evil of ≈øuffering; they will be out of the reach of their mo≈øt powerful and malicious adver≈øaries. Now what little rea≈øon hath a Believer that hath an intere≈øt in the Kingdom of Glory, to be di≈ømayed at his worldly troubles, which ≈øhall ≈øo ≈øoon be done away, when he hath a title to everla≈øting happine≈øs to ≈øupport him? Who is there that would be di≈ømayed at the ≈øufferings of a few years or weeks, if he were a≈ø≈øured of an eternal weight of glory to make him amends for it. Thus much for the Doctrinal part.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>SE</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>Is it ≈øo, that a Believers intere≈øt in the Kingdom of Heaven ≈øhould make him chearful and couragious in the wayes of God, and keep him from being di≈ømayed at the ≈øufferings and afflictions that he meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth withal in the World? Is it ≈øo, that one that hath a title to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, hath cau≈øe of joy in the mid≈øt of his greate≈øt forrows and troubles? Then</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt of all, Here is matter of tryal and examination for us to try our ≈øelves whether we have a title to Heaven or no: We would all rejoyce to have ≈øomewhat which might effectually ≈øupport us, and bear us up under troubles and afflictions in the World, and it is ≈øad when we are in trouble, if we have nothing to ≈øupport us; but if we have ≈øecured our heavenly intere≈øt, and have cleared our title to the Kingdom of Glory, we have then the greate≈øt ground of comfort and joy in the World, and we may upon right grounds rejoyce un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ≈øharpe≈øt tribulations that we meet with from the hands of
<pb facs="tcp:62760:254"/>men. I ≈øhall therefore give you ≈øome marks and characters how we may know, whether we have an intere≈øt in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or no. And here I might refer you back to tho≈øe characters propounded in the application of the former Doctrine; if we can truly ≈øay that God is our Father by Adoption and Regeneration, and that we are his Children, then we may ≈øafely conclude, that we are ≈øome of tho≈øe that have an intere≈øt in the Kingdom of Heaven; if we are the Children of God, then we are coheirs of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to Heaven; try then whether you can conclude that you are the Children of God. But becau≈øe I know not whether ever I ≈øhall have libert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> to ≈øpeak to you again from this place, I ≈øhall propo≈øe ≈øome other characters al≈øo to help us to pa≈øs a right judgment upon our ≈øelves in a matter of ≈øo great concernment.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Then who≈øoever thou art that woulde≈øt try thy title to the Heavenly Glory, thou mai≈øt try it by this: If the de≈øign of thy life be to glorifie God, and to promote their Heavenly intere≈øt, then thou art one of tho≈øe that are intitled to the Heavenly Inheritance; if thou drive≈øt a Trade for Heaven, and if that the obtaining of Heaven be the principal part of thy care and bu≈øine≈øs, and the great de≈øign that thou drive≈øt at in all thy actions, then by this thou maye≈øt try thy title to Heaven. Apply now this home to thy ≈øoul, what Trade and de≈øign art thou now driving in the world? Is it thy main bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈øs here to promote thy temporal or thine eternal ≈øtate? Art thou ≈øtriving more after Earth or Heaven? If thy de≈øign here be after Riches, Honour or Greatne≈øs in the World? and make≈øt all thy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ≈øub≈øervient to thy de≈øign, then thou art none of tho≈øe that have a Title to Heaven; But if it be the bu≈øine≈øs of thy life, and the Trade that thou drive≈øt in the World to advance Gods glory, and thine eternal ≈øalvation, and do≈øt care for no more of this World, than may tend to promote Gods glory, and thine eternal happine≈øs; then thou mai≈øt ≈øafely conclude that thy name is written in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and that thou ha≈øt an intere≈øt in that Kingdom. It is the grand mi≈øtake of Thou≈øands of ≈øouls every where, that they pretend to ≈øeek after the Kingdom of Heaven, but they ≈øeek it only by the by, and their main de≈øign in the World is ≈øomewhat el≈øe, as to grow Rich, or Great, or Honourable here; They do not make it their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal bu≈øine≈øs, and their great de≈øign to ≈øecure their Title to Heaven; But the look upon Heaven onely as a re≈øerve for them, when they can enjoy the World no longer; And therefore they will have ≈øome glances, and ≈øome faint endeavours that way; But if ever we
<pb facs="tcp:62760:255"/>will enter into Heaven, we mu≈øt fir≈øt of all ≈øeek Gods Kingdom and his righteou≈øne≈øs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.31.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Woulde≈øt thou know whether thou ha≈øt a Title to the Heavenly glory, or no: Thou maye≈øt know it by thy heavenly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edne≈øs: They that have an intere≈øt in the Heavenly Kingdom, they have Heavenly hearts; if their Trea≈øure be in Heaven, their hearts will be there al≈øo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.20, 21. <hi>Lay up for your ≈øelves trea≈øures in Heaven, where neither Moth, nor Ru≈øt can corrupt, and Thieves break through and ≈øteal; for where your Trea≈øure is, there will your hearts be al≈øo.</hi> And is it ≈øo with us, are our hearts taken up with the Heavenly glory? Are our meditations and contemplations much on Heavenly objects? Or el≈øe, are they taken up only or mo≈øtly with earthly vanities? Are our hearts on our Riches, Plea≈øures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or el≈øe are they placed upon Heaven, and Heavenly things? If we have a title, to the Kingdom of Heaven, our hearts, minds and affections, will be Heavenly, and taken up with Heavenly Objects, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>If ye then be ri≈øen with Chri≈øt, ≈øeek tho≈øe things which are above, where Chri≈øt ≈øitteth at the right hand of God. Set your affections on things above, and not on things on the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Woulde≈øt thou know whether thou ha≈øt an intere≈øt in the Kingdom of Heaven, or no? How do≈øt thou like the employment of Heaven? if thou like≈øt the employment of Heaven, then thou maye≈øt comfortably conclude, that thou ha≈øt an intere≈øt in the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Can≈øt thou ≈øay thou delighte≈øt to be employed in ≈øerving, and in glorifying God, and in wor≈øhipping of him in ≈øpirit and truth, according to his word? Can≈øt thou ≈øay in truth, that thou delighte≈øt to do the will of God here on earth, as it is done by the Angels in heaven, and the ≈øpirits of ju≈øt men made perfect there? Do≈øt thou take delight to be employed in that employment that the Saints of heaven are, and ≈øhall be for ever employed in? Do≈øt thou take plea≈øure to adore, and prai≈øe, and magnifie the ever ble≈ø≈øed God? Do≈øt thou take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure in the duties of Religion, and rejoyce to be conver≈øing with God in prayer, and in other holy exerci≈øes, and to be enjoying communion with him? if it be thus with thee, as I have now de≈øcribed: this, this will evidently make out thy Title for Heaven. Many Thou≈øands pretend that their de≈øigns are to go to Heaven, and they pre≈øumptuou≈øly conclude that they have an intere≈øt in that Kingdom, when as they like not the Heavenly employment in them≈øelves or others, and they care not to get acquaintance with God here on earth, and are ≈øtrangers to the duties of Religion, and to a life of holine≈øs, and perhaps ≈øpends and hour in a week,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:255"/>or it may be in a moneth in ≈øecret prayer, or in other holy exerci≈øes; and it may be neglect the wor≈øhip of God in their <hi>Families</hi> too; but if we are unacquainted with the imployment of Heaven, which is to prai≈øe and magnifie, wor≈øhip and adore God; if thou delighte≈øt not ≈øo to do, thou can≈øt not conclude that thou ha≈øt a Title to Heaven: but if thou ha≈øt an intere≈øt in the Kingdom of Heaven, then thou do≈øt mo≈øt of all delight in that imployment which hath mo≈øt of Heaven in it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If thou ha≈øt an intere≈øt in the Kingdom of Heaven, thou ha≈øt a ≈øpecial love to the heirs of Heaven; and thou ha≈øt a near and dear af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the people of God though they be de≈øpi≈øed, rejected, ≈øcorned, and per≈øecuted by the prophane world; and thou do≈øt delight in the company of tho≈øe on Earth, which are like to be thy companions in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and thou had≈øt rather have the ≈øociety of tho≈øe how≈øoever mean and low in the world, that have the trueth of grace in them, than of all the ≈øtately and glittering gallants of the World, that are ≈øtrangers to a Life of holine≈øs; and the more holy and heavenly they are in their hearts, and lives, the more amiable will their company be to thee, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 3.14. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 15.4. Put thy ≈øelf to the que≈øtion whether it be thus with thee, or no, and thou ≈øhalt finde out thy title to heaven thereby.</p>
            <p>La≈øtly, If thou ha≈øt a title to Heaven, then thou art ≈øo far at a point with all the riches, and plea≈øures, and enjoyments of the World, as that thou wilt rather forgo them all, than for≈øake Chri≈øt; and rather part with them all, rather than they ≈øhall hinder thee in thy way towards Heaven; and if thou art brought ≈øo far at a pinch, as that thou mu≈øt either for≈øake thy intere≈øt in Chri≈øt and Heaven; or to forgo thy world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accommodations; thou art very willing to forgo them all that thou maye≈øt ≈øtick clo≈øe to Chri≈øt, and go forward in thy way to thy Heavenly Inheritance; thus it was with the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8. But what things (≈øaith he) were gain to me, tho≈øe I accounted lo≈øs for Chri≈øt; <hi>Yea, doubtle≈øs I account all things but lo≈øs for the exce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By the≈øe things, Beloved, you may try whether you have an intere≈øt in Heaven or no. Having fini≈øhed the U≈øe of Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ≈øhall come to the next U≈øe, which is the la≈øt that I ≈øhall ≈øpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, which an U≈øe of Exhortation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:256"/>Is it ≈øo, that the con≈øideration of a Believers intere≈øt in the Heavenly Glory is enough to bear up his ≈øpirit under all the trials and tribulations of this Life, then, Oh that you which cannot upon Trial finde, that you have a title to Heaven, that you would labour after an intere≈øt in the Heavenly Glory; if thou ha≈øt no intere≈øt there, what good will all the enjoyments of the World do thee? how quickly will all thy comforts and plea≈øures leave thee? and what little cau≈øe ha≈øt thou to rejoyce in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of outward things, if thou ha≈øt no title to the durable <hi>riches?</hi> if thou art void of the riches of grace here, and ha≈øt no title to the riches of Glory hereafter; what wilt thou do in a day of Tryal, and in an hour of trouble and calamity? What wilt thou do when Lo≈ø≈øes, Cro≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, Troubles and Vexations ≈øhall compa≈øs thee about, if thou ha≈øt not an Heavenly intere≈øt to ≈øupport thee under them? What wilt thou do, when Pains and Angui≈øh, when Di≈øea≈øes, Sickne≈øs and Death ≈øhall ≈øeize upon thee, if thou ha≈øt not a Title to thy Heavenly inheritance? The≈øe things will certainly and ≈øpeedily come upon us, how far off ≈øoever we may put them in our thoughts; the proud looks of the lofty will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be turned into an earthly palene≈øs; though they look as big, and carry them≈øelves as high, as if they had a protection from Hell and the Grave; and tho≈øe bodies which we now take ≈øo much care to plea≈øe and pamper, will ≈øhortly become a fea≈øt for Worms; though they may be adorned with all the Ornaments that the pride of man can invent, and friends, and riches, and will but accompany us to the Grave, and there leave us; and Oh what will then become of us, if we have no intere≈øt in Chri≈øt and Heaven, and can no lay claim to the eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If you ask me, how we ≈øhall do to ≈øecure our intere≈øt in the Kingdom of Heaven? I an≈øwer, it mu≈øt be by a through clo≈øure with Chri≈øt by ≈øaith, and chu≈øing of him for our Lord and Saviour; God hath ordained that tho≈øe that are united to Chri≈øt by faith here on earth, that they ≈øhall be with Chri≈øt; and live with Chri≈øt in Heaven: Heaven and Glory is the Dowry that God giveth with his Son Je≈øus Chri≈øt; and they that will Marry the Heir ≈øhall have the Inheritance; and if we are Chri≈øts, then all will be ours, 1 Cor. 3.22, 23. <hi>Whether of</hi> Paul, <hi>or</hi> Apo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Let us therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract our ≈øelves to Chri≈øt: re≈øolving to be no longer our own, but his; and to live no longer to our ≈øelves, but to him; let us chu≈øe him to be our Lord and Saviour, and take him upon his own Terms as he is offered
<pb facs="tcp:62760:256"/>to us in the Go≈øpel, to be our King, Prie≈øt, and Prophet; and when we are once thus united to Chri≈øt by faith, we ≈øhall be coheirs with him of the heavenly Inheritance; all this will be ours when we are Chri≈øts by a ≈øelf-re≈øignation, and ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion, and when Chri≈øt is ours by a believing choice and election; when we have thus made choice of Chri≈øt upon his own terms to be our Lord and Saviour, our portion and our all: and have given up our ≈øelves to him to be wholly his, and at his di≈øpo≈øe: this will undoubtedly give us a ≈ø<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, The next addre≈øs that I have to make, is to tho≈øe that are the Heirs of this Kingdom, and have a Title to this Heavenly Inheritance.

            <p>Did we ≈øeriou≈øly con≈øider how great hinderers, riches &amp; plea≈øures, and worldly pro≈øperity are to grace and holine≈øs, we ≈øhould not be ≈øo di≈øcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented at our mean and afflicted condition in the World, nor ≈øo over-de≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of tho≈øe accommodations which have proved the bane of ≈øo many, and the hinderers of their ≈øalvation; peace and plenty, honor and pro≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, doth very often increa≈øe pride and covetou≈øne≈øs, ≈øecurity, and earthly-mindedne≈øs; when as affliction, tribulation, want, reproach, being ≈øanctified by God, doth tend to the exerci≈øing and increa≈øing of patience, humility, and a heavenly conver≈øation; and upon this con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul gloryed in tribulations, becau≈øe it wrought in him the grace of patience, Rom.</hi> 5.3. and not only ≈øo (≈øaith he) <hi>but we glory in tribulations al≈øo, knowing that tribulation worketh patience, &amp;c.</hi> There are many ≈øouls now in torments for that pride, ≈øecurity, worldly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and other ≈øins which were nouri≈øhed and fo≈øtered up in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øperity in the world: and many ≈øouls now in heaven which were helped forward in their way thither by the exerci≈øe of tho≈øe graces which were nouri≈øhed and encrea≈øed by their adver≈øity, cro≈ø≈øes, and calamities here below. Be not therefore di≈ømayed and di≈øcontented Chri≈øtian with that condition, though it be grievous to thy frail fle≈øh, which doth tend to the encrea≈øing of grace and holine≈øs.</p>
            <p>La≈øtly, thou that art a believer, &amp; heir of heaven, art thou in affliction,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:259"/>be not di≈ømayed, becau≈øe the≈øe things being ≈øanctified by God will tend to the fitting of thy ≈øoul for, and to the bringing of thee nearer to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; afflictions and tribulations do tend to the uniting of ≈øouls clo≈øer to Chri≈øt, and to the fitting and preparing them more and more for eternal glory; and hence it is that God hath ordained that through many tribulations we mu≈øt enter into glory, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.22. God doth di≈øcipline his dear Children by ≈øorrows and troubles here, and ≈øo fit them for to raign with him hereafter, and ≈øhall we be di≈ømayed at ≈øuch a condition that doth tend to the fitting of us for our Heavenly Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to the bringing of us nearer to Chri≈øt and Salvation? Oh let not afflictions nor tribulations di≈ømay you that have an intere≈øt in the Kingdom of Heaven to ≈øupport you, but let the con≈øideration of your Heavenly intere≈øt keep you from fainting at all your afflictions and tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations that you meet with in your way to Heaven.</p>
            <p>And now beloved hearers, give me leave to tre≈øpa≈øs a little more upon your patience, ≈øeeing this is like to be the la≈øt opportunity that I ≈øhall have to ≈øpeak to you from this place, being prohibited to preach, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs upon ≈øuch terms as I confe≈øs my con≈øcience dares not ≈øubmit unto; being therefore enforced to lay down my Mini≈øtry, I thought good to let you know that it is neither out of ≈øingularity nor ≈øtubbornne≈øs in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, which many it may be may conjecture, but becau≈øe the things required are ≈øuch as my con≈øcience cannot clo≈øe withal; could I ≈øee a ≈øufficient warrant from the Word of God for tho≈øe Ceremonies and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things that are enjoyned, I ≈øhould readily ≈øubmit unto them; for I can take the great God to witne≈øs with my con≈øcience that nothing in the world grieveth me a hundred part ≈øo much as to be hindred from the work of the Mini≈øtry, and to be di≈øabled from ≈øerving my great Ma≈øter Chri≈øt in that employment: but ≈øeeing I cannot finde my war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant thence, I dare not go again≈øt my con≈øcience, and ≈øo do evil that good may come thereby. Tho≈øe ≈øtrict prohibitions recorded, <hi>Deut.</hi> 42. and 12.32. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.6. and in other Scriptures, wherein we are prohibited to make any addition to Gods own in≈øtitutions in his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip, and the terrible threatnings pronounced again≈øt tho≈øe that ≈øhall tran≈øgre≈øs in this particular, hath ≈øuch impre≈ø≈øion: upon my heart, that I dare not give my a≈ø≈øent nor con≈øent to any thing in Gods! Wor≈øhip which is not warranted from his word; but I think it the le≈ø≈øer evil of the two to expo≈øe my ≈øelf to ≈øufferings in the world, rather than to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the checks and reproaches of a wounded and grieved con≈øcience.</p>
            <p>Dearly beloved, While I had liberty to ≈øpeak unto you, I may ≈øay
<pb facs="tcp:62760:259"/>with the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 20.27. I have not ≈øhunned to declare unto you the whole coun≈øel of God; but according to that ≈øtrength and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that God hath given me, have laboured to in≈øtruct you, and to pre≈øs home upon you tho≈øe great and ≈øaving truths which are of nece≈ø≈øity to be known and practi≈øed, in order to ≈øalvation. And as the Apol≈øte <hi>Paul</hi> writ to the <hi>Philippians, Phil.</hi> 1.8. So may I ≈øay to you, that God is my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, how greatly I have longed after you all in the bowels of Je≈øus Chri≈øt: your conver≈øation unto God, and eternal ≈øalvation, is that which I have had in my eye; for this I have prayed, for this I have preached, for this I have ≈øtudied; neither is there any thing more joyous to me, than to hear of any of my hearers that are walking in the truth, and that have ≈øet their faces towards Heaven.</p>
            <p>But ≈øeeing God is plea≈øed (for ends be≈øt known to him≈øelf) to ≈øuffer my Mouth, together with the Mouths of many others, my Dear and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Brethren in the Mini≈øtry to be ≈øtopped, I de≈øire to leave a word or two with each of you, which I would have you to look upon as the words of a dying Mini≈øter, or of a dead Mini≈øter, in a civil ≈øence; and therefore ≈øuffer them to take the deeper impre≈ø≈øion upon your hearts; I ≈øhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore direct a word or two to three ≈øorts of per≈øons.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, To tho≈øe that do much rejoyce at this time, and that have ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øtly looked and longed for it; to ≈øuch who hug them≈øelves, and make merry becau≈øe the troublers of <hi>I≈ørael</hi> (as wicked men account the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters of Chri≈øt to be) which have told them of their ≈øins, and reproved them of their carnal, ≈øen≈øual, unholy lives, are not ≈øuffered to preach, nor to trouble them with the unplea≈øing Doctrines of repentance, conver≈øion, mortification of ≈øin, and other truths which they di≈ølike; to tho≈øe who look upon the faithful, laborious, convincing preachers of the Word of God to be their enemies, becau≈øe they have told them the truth, and could not ≈øooth them up in their ≈øins; and rejoyce as the inbabitants of the earth did rejoyce over the Witne≈ø≈øes, and make merry, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.10.</p>
            <p>To you I ≈øay, who≈øoever you are, that none have more need of our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and of our preaching than you; and if you were but acquainted truly with your own ≈øtate in which you are (which is a ≈øtate of death and wrath, without you repent, and turn, and become new creatures) you would be of other minds than now you are: and turn your mirth and jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity into mourning. Con≈øider, that is never the better with any City when the watchmen are removed, nor for a traveller when the light is gone which ≈øhould direct him in his way; and it cannot be but ≈øad, when ≈øo many thou≈øands of godly Mini≈øters, which by their doctrine and lives have been
<pb facs="tcp:62760:260"/>as Lights in the world, ≈øhall be extingui≈øhed and ≈øilenced: believe it Sirs, there is no good groping out our way to Heaven in the dark, when as we know not whether our next ≈øtep will be in Heaven, or Hell in eternal joy, or mi≈øery. A Sick man is never the nearer health, becau≈øe his Phy≈øician is not ≈øuffered to ≈øpeak to him of the danger of his Di≈øea≈øe; and carnal and ungodly men are never the nearer their ≈øalvation, becau≈øe their faithful Mini≈øters are not ≈øuffered to preach to them of the evil and danger of their ≈øins, which are the hinderers of it. I ≈øhall commend to your con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration that one Scripture, which I would have you be often reading, and thinking on, as it is recorded, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17, 18. The time is come that judgment mu≈øt begin at the hou≈øe of God; and if it begin at us, what ≈øhall the end be of them that obey not the Go≈øpel of Chri≈øt; and if the righteous ≈øcarcely be ≈øaved, where ≈øhall the ungodly, and the ≈øinner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear? If God begin with his faithful Mini≈øters to cha≈øti≈øe and afflict them; Oh what then will become of the wicked and ungodly world! if the godly drink fu≈øt of this Cup, it is becau≈øe the wicked ≈øhall drink the dregs of it.</p>
            <p>A ≈øecond ≈øort of per≈øons which I ≈øhall ≈øpeak to, are ≈øuch who are halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between two; that are like <hi>Agrippa,</hi> almo≈øt per≈øwaded to be Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; that have ≈øome convictions upon their con≈øciences, of the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the ways of God, but yet their intere≈øt leads them another way, they are unwilling to expo≈øe them≈øelves to any troubles or tribulations, by going again≈øt the ≈øtream of the world, they are afraid that if they ≈øhould be diligent in the duties of Religion, and ≈øhould walk holily and clo≈øely with God, that then they ≈øhould be reproached and ≈øcorned, or per≈øecuted by the World, and therefore they will go on a little way, but no farther than that they may retreat back again with ea≈øe and ≈øafety as to their carnal and worldly intere≈øts; to ≈øuch who≈øoever you are I mu≈øt tell you, Fir≈øt, that you mu≈øt go beyond the common ≈øort of the World, unle≈øs you will intend to come ≈øhort of Heaven, you mu≈øt not take the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the multitude to be a ≈øufficient warrant for you to walk by; the broad way, though it be to your corrupt natures the mo≈øt plea≈øant way, yet it is not the ≈øafe≈øt, but the mo≈øt dangerous way; and the narrow way of holine≈øs and godline≈øs will be found at la≈øt to be <hi>the way leading to life, though there be but few that finde it,</hi> Mat<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> 7.13, 15. they that are afraid of making too much ado for Heaven, they are like to have nothing at all to do with Heaven; it is a Chri≈øtians duty, and ≈øhould be his care, not to be <hi>conformed to the world, but to be transformed by the renewing of their minde, that they may prove what is that good, and acceptable and perfect will of God,</hi> Rom. 12.2.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:260"/>Secondly, you mu≈øt not ≈øtick at afflictions and cro≈ø≈øes in the World if you intend to go to Heaven. Chri≈øts cro≈øs is the fir≈øt that mu≈øt be learnt by Chri≈øts Di≈øciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.27. you mu≈øt account upon it before hand, that if you will live godly in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, you mu≈øt ≈øuffer per≈øecution, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. You mu≈øt not be afraid of the reproaches of the ungodly, nor flinch at oppo≈øitions and tribulations, if you intend to be everla≈øtingly happy: the fearful are in the forefront of them that march to Hell, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. <hi>but the fearful and unbelieving and abominable,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>≈øhall have their part in the Lake which burneth with fire and brim≈øtone, which is the ≈øecond death.</hi> The fearful you ≈øet down in the front in that black Li≈øt there mentioned; <hi>But the Kingdom of Heaven ≈øuffers violence, and the violent take it by force.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The end will pay for all; the Kingdom of Heaven will make you amends for all the tribulations that you meet with in your way to Heaven.</p>
            <p>La≈øtly, I ≈øhall ≈øpeak a word to tho≈øe that fear the Lord, and are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in the practi≈øe of godline≈øs, that are very much grieved that their faithful Teachers would be removed into corners, my advice that I have to give you be≈øides what I have ≈øpoken before, is the ≈øame with <hi>Pauls</hi> to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> Chap 4.1. <hi>My brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, ≈øo ≈øtand fa≈øt in the Lord my dearly beloved.</hi> Con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your Heavenly intere≈øt, and let that bear you up under all your worldly troubles and per≈øecutions: let not the terrour nor threats of men nor devils make you ≈øtir a part from the Doctrine which is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to godline≈øs, though you may be ≈øcorned and afflicted by men, yet the day will come when you will be publickly owned and honoured by the Lord of glory, and when Chri≈øt which is your life ≈øhall appear, then ≈øhall you appear with him in glory? be not affrighted at the ≈øuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of your Mini≈øters, though they ≈øhould be far greater than now they are; nor di≈øcouraged at the back≈øliding of hypocritical profe≈ø≈øors, who having formerly made fair pretences to religion and reformation, yet are turned with the dog to their old vomit again<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and by their ≈øo doing do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that it is their carnal intere≈øts only that they look unto, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will be for religion and reformation, ≈øo long as that may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted thereby, and no longer: but labour to imitate the heroick courage of <hi>Jo≈øhua,</hi> who re≈øolved that he and his Hou≈øe would ≈øerve the Lord, though all <hi>I≈ørael</hi> ≈øhould for≈øake him and back≈ølide from him. Stand fa≈øt, I be≈øeech you in the faith, quit your ≈øelves like men, be ≈øtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, put on the whole armour of God, that you may be able to ≈øtand in the evil day; and having done
<pb facs="tcp:62760:261"/>all to ≈øtand, let not the enmity nor oppo≈øition of the ungodly make you to for≈øake the duties of Religion, and the ways of holine≈øs; think not the better of that way, or of tho≈øe per≈øons meerly becau≈øe they pro≈øper in the world, nor the wor≈øe of tho≈øe meerly becau≈øe they are per≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted and afflicted. What were tho≈øe that were tortured not accepting deliverance, that had tryal of cruel mockings and ≈øcourgings, yea more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over of bonds and impri≈øonment; that were ≈øtoned, that were ≈øawen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øunder, that were tempted, that were ≈ølain by the ≈øword; they that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered about in ≈øheeps-skins, and goats-skins; being de≈øtitute, afflicted, tormented, <hi>Heb.</hi> 22.35, 36, 37. <hi>They were ≈øuch of whom the world was not worthy,</hi> ver≈ø. 38. True holine≈øs and the fear of God are never the le≈øs lovely in Gods account, becau≈øe it is rejected, ≈øcorned, and condemned by the wicked world; and ≈øin and prophanene≈øs is never a whit the more plea≈øing unto Chri≈øt becau≈øe it is in fa≈øhion, and practi≈øed by the greate≈øt or mo≈øt of men. Finally my brethren, commit your ≈øelves and your way unto the Lord, and wait patiently for him, he will command deliverance for you in his own time. Snatch not after deliverance by any prepo≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and unlawful cour≈øes, before God holdeth it out to you, le≈øt you provoke him to detain it the longer from you.</p>
            <p>To conclude all, I ≈øhall take leave of you in the words of the Holy Gho≈øt, recorded, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.32. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.20, 21. And now brethren, I ≈øhall commend you to God, &amp; to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among them that are ≈øanctified. And the God of peace which brought again from the dead our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt the great Shepherd of the ≈øheep through the blood of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la≈øting Covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well plea≈øing in his ≈øight, through Je≈øus Chri≈øt, to whom be glory for ever and ever.</p>

            <p>THe Subject of this Chapter is a ≈øad Story, and Tragical Relation of a dying Je≈øus. In the beginning of this Go≈øpel, you may ≈øee him coming into the World in a Shower, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.13. And now in the end of it, you finde him going out in a Storm, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.22.</p>
            <p>Alas! that ≈øo good a Ghe≈øt ≈øhould find ≈øo bad a welcome, and that the Lord of Life ≈øhould ≈øo ≈øoon be put to death. When the Angels, tho≈øe Heavenly Chori≈øters fir≈øt ≈øang that <hi>Chri≈øtmas Carol,</hi> of a Saviour that was born into the World, <hi>Luke.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. one would have thought the World ≈øhould have fallen a dancing after ≈øuch Evangelical Mu≈øick, and that all hearts ≈øhould have [like the Babe in <hi>Elizabeths</hi> womb] leapt for joy, <hi>at the news of a new born Prince:</hi> But it was quite contrary; for in≈øtead of joyning in that Heavenly Quire, in gratulating the happy arrival of this young King into their Country; they take the Alarum of his Birth as if an Enemy had landed in their Coa≈øts: And hereupon <hi>Herod</hi> pre≈øently heads an Army; goes out again≈øt him, and makes the poor Prince to fly the Country, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.13, 14.</p>
            <p>But though the meane≈øt of his Birth, Extraction, and De≈øcent may give them di≈øta≈øt at fir≈øt, yet when he begins to di≈øplay his Divinity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, by working ≈øuch amazing Miracles, as none could work, and Preaching ≈øuch moving Sermons as none could ever Preach: Oh, then they will recant their Error, and own their Saviour, <hi>and the joyful ≈øhout of a King will be heard among≈øt them;</hi> as it is expre≈ø≈øed in <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.21.</p>

               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Ah poor ≈øoul!

Thirdly, Is it ≈øo, then ever make Gods <hi>will</hi> the <hi>Standards</hi> of yours, and think not to bring down his will to yours, but re≈øign up your will to his. That Epitapth would not become a Chri≈øtian Tomb-≈øtone, which was found Engraven upon a Mi≈øers Monuments, <hi>Here lies one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt his will;</hi> the ble≈ø≈øed Apo≈øtle was of another minde, when he ≈øaid, <hi>I have learnt in what ever ≈øtate I am, therewith to be content.</hi> Many can be content in an Honorable E≈øtate, or in a wealthy E≈øtate, or in a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful or pro≈øperous E≈øtate: but to be reproacht, and yet content, to be bely'd, and yet content; to be affronted, and wrong'd, and yet content, in ≈øuch E≈øtates as the≈øe to be content, is far above <hi>Nature,</hi> and none can do it, but he that hath learnt it, <hi>I have learnt,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But alas! how few Scholars hath this Great Doctor St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Heavenly Academy! Children can learn to be proud, can learn to be covetous, can learn to be undutiful to their Parents, can learn to lye and ≈øwear, before they have well learnt to ≈øpeak. But he mu≈øt be a Man, nay more than a Man, that can learn to love an Enemy, to forgive an injury, and with <hi>Paul,</hi> to be content with every Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency.</p>
            <p>For the Lords ≈øake [MAN] ply this le≈ø≈øon well, if thine Enemy lay thy Honour low, intreat the Lord to lay thy heart as low, and be content: If Authority bring thy E≈øtate down, be≈øeech God to bring thy Spirit down, and be content; when thy comforts runs a tilt, and thy ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øings runs dregs, then let patience have her perfect work, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,

            <p>
               <hi>Mahomet,</hi> when he could not make the Mountain come down to it, he went up to the Mountain: So when thou can≈øt not enlarge thy Dominions to thy minde, then confine thy minde to thy Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and when thou ha≈øt more, be the more thankful, and when thou ha≈øt le≈øs, be content. This is the third U≈øe, <hi>Make Gods will the ≈øtan dard of yours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if you put <hi>Pauls</hi> Query, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi>

               <item>2. God would have you bear his Cro≈øs, and ≈øuffer patiently.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Fir≈øt, It's Gods will you ≈øhould live piou≈øly. For the proof of this you may read, 1 <hi>The≈ø.</hi> 4.3, 4. <hi>This is the will of God,</hi> what is? <hi>even this, ≈øaith</hi> Paul; <hi>your Sanctification,</hi> that every one of you ≈øhould po≈ø≈øe≈øs your ve≈ø≈øel in holine≈øs? Mark this, in holine≈øs, and if ≈øo, what will become of all tho≈øe befooled and abu≈øed ≈øouls, who debauch their ve≈ø≈øel with unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and defile them≈øelves with drunkenne≈øs? If <hi>Bel≈øhazar</hi> was ≈øo ≈øeverely puni≈øht for di≈ø≈øecrating and prophaning the Ve≈ø≈øels of the Temple de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated unto God, of how much ≈øorer puni≈øhment ≈øhall the≈øe wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches be thought worthy, who have adulterated and defiled the Temple of the Holy Gho≈øt? He drank intemperately to the honour of his Idol, only in dead Ve≈ø≈øels of Gold and Silver; But the≈øe in doing thus, abu≈øe living Ve≈ø≈øels, living bodies, and living ≈øouls; ≈øuch Ve≈ø≈øels as by Bapti≈øm were markt out for God, and ≈øeparated and ≈øealed to his holy ≈øervice, they abu≈øe and pro≈øtitute to a Lu≈øt, to a Whore, to the Devil. Ah! who can but weep, and weep again to ≈øee how much of our <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Bloud is poy≈øon'd with the≈øe bea≈øtly Enormities at this day; and how many of our [otherwi≈øe hopeful] Gentlemen, who might do God and their Country much ≈øervice, and be a great help to the publick good, and peculiar ble≈ø≈øing to the place where they live, do ba≈øely and unworthily melt away their youth, and Ema≈øculate their ≈øpirits in drunken Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Effeminate Embraces.</p>

            <p>Ah deluded and degenerated Gentlemen! think with your ≈øelves ≈øeriou≈øly, what an≈øwer you will make to your Judge at the general Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit-day, for taking the Members of Chri≈øt, and making them members of an Harlot.</p>

            <p>Before <hi>Enoch</hi> was tran≈ølated to Heaven, he walkt holily upon Earth, el≈øe God had never de≈øired his Company ≈øo ≈øoon as he did.

O hear me then while you may, and pray with me while you may; and accept of the tender of Salvation from me, while you may; <hi>Yet a little while, and you that have ≈øeen me, ≈øhall ≈øee me no more;</hi> and you that have heard me, (as <hi>Job</hi> ≈øaith) ≈øhall ≈øay, <hi>Where is he?</hi> It's but a little, and tho≈øe Seats ≈øhall have other Hearers, and this Pulpit have another Preacher; It's but a little that you have to hear, and I have to ≈øpeak in this place, and ≈øhall not my <hi>Dying words, be Living words</hi> to you? ≈øhall my <hi>Farewel-Sermon be a forgotten Sermon?</hi> and the la≈øt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øt I am like to make to you, be repul≈øed and ≈ølighted by you, O my dear Neighbours and Friends, <hi>of whom I travel till Chri≈øt be formed in you;</hi> Awake, and live, <hi>≈øeek the Lord before the Grave and Hell ≈øhut their mouths upon you,</hi> and before the Servant of the Lord, ≈øent now to warn you, take his la≈øt leave of you, and ≈øee your faces no more.</p>
            <p>I am wounded, I am wounded, to think this Sermon ≈øhould be <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,</hi> before all your Souls be <hi>Converted,</hi> and to leave any of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, walking on in Hell Road, when I am gone; Oh that I knew but what to do, to get you to do that to day, which mu≈øt be done, or you may be undone to morrow.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:62760:268"/>though I were ≈øure to go to Pri≈øon as ≈øoon as I come forth of the Pulpit, yet I ≈øhould think all well be≈øtowed, could I but ≈øee you begin to turn this Sermon into practice, <hi>And to follow peace and holine≈øs, without which you cannot ≈øee the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh what a joyful hours work would I e≈øteem this, and how heartily would I ble≈øs your God and my God, that pro≈øpered his Word in the mouth of his ≈øervant, <hi>making it a Salvation Word to as many as our Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witne≈ø≈øes of it this day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the fir≈øt Argument, I be≈øeech you for <hi>my ≈øake.</hi> Little do you think what a joy it's to your Mini≈øter to ≈øee his Children (as St. <hi>John</hi> ≈øpeaks) <hi>walking in the truth.</hi> And on the contrary, what an affliction, to ≈øee you <hi>walk in Error, and Sin.</hi> Little do you think what a comfort it's to me to think of making this account to God at the Judgment day, <hi>Here are the Children which thou gave≈øt me, and I have lo≈øt none.</hi> And on the other hand, what an aking it is to my heart, to think of be≈øpeaking God at that time, on this manner, <hi>Here are none of the Children,</hi> O Lord, none of the Souls that thou did≈øt commit to my tru≈øt, <hi>for I have lo≈øt them all.</hi> But I hope better things of you, though I thus ≈øpeak.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Secondly, I be≈øeech you for <hi>your own ≈øakes.</hi> Who will have the wor≈øe of it, if this advice be not followed, you or I? Alas, though it may be matter of <hi>Grief</hi> to me, yet not of <hi>Guilt:</hi> God will reward me according to my labour, not according to my ≈øucce≈øs. We are, ≈øaid the Apo≈øtle, <hi>A ≈øweet Savour of Chri≈øt in them that peri≈øh,</hi> mark, in them that peri≈øh, as well as in them that be <hi>≈øaved.</hi> Though the <hi>Patient</hi> dye, yet the <hi>Phy≈øitian</hi> mu≈øt be paid: So albeit the people dye in their ≈øins, yet Gods Mini≈øters may comfortably conclude with the Prophet, <hi>I≈øa.</hi> 49.4. <hi>Though I have laboured in vain, and ≈øpent my ≈øtrength for nought, yet ≈øure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my Judgment is with the Lord, and my work</hi> (namely, the reward of my work) <hi>with my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ah my friends, it's you that will have the wor≈øt of it one day, if this Sermon be not faithfully followed, and obeyed; Read at your lea≈øure <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.16, 17, 18, and ≈øee whether I ≈øpeak truth or a lye; It's you that mu≈øt have the reward of puni≈øhment; It's you that mu≈øt ≈øtand or fall, that mu≈øt be the <hi>Subjects</hi> of the plea≈øures of Heaven, or the <hi>Objects</hi> of all the pains in Hell; and ≈øhould not you then be as much concern'd for your ≈øelves, as I am for you? Now you enjoy your health, and the ≈øad Accents of a dying ≈øinner are not heard in your habitations, but will it be always thus? Now each of you ≈øit under his Vine with delight, and there is no carrying into Captivity, <hi>nor no crying in your ≈øtreets,</hi> but will
<pb facs="tcp:62760:269"/>≈øuch times la≈øt always. Now you can hawk, hunt, ≈øwear and drink, and then you think you are qualified like <hi>Gentlemen;</hi> but will this la≈øt always? Suppo≈øe thou had≈øt a Crown on thy Head, how long would≈øt thou wear it? Suppo≈øe thou had≈øt a Scepter in thy Hand, how long would≈øt thou hold it? They are ≈øick at <hi>Rome,</hi> and dye in Princes Courts, as well as at the Spittle; yea, Kings them≈øelves cannot keep their Crowns on their heads, <hi>nor their heads on their ≈øhoulders,</hi> but mu≈øt ≈øtoop when death ≈øtrikes, <hi>and go as naked to their Beds of Du≈øt, as other men;</hi> and in that day all their thoughts, their projects, and their plea≈øures peri≈øh with them; only their guilt of their ≈øins, which were the Ladders, by which they did climb up to the top of their plea≈øures, the top of their honors, and preferments will dog them into another world. Hence ≈øaid <hi>Abner</hi> to <hi>Joah,</hi> 2 Sam. 2.26. <hi>Know'≈øt thou not that the≈øe things will be bitterne≈øs in the end?</hi> You will now have your ≈øweet-meats, and your ≈øweet drinks, your ≈øweet plea≈øures and pa≈øtimes, let the Mini≈øter ≈øay what he will, <hi>but do not you know that this will be bitterne≈øs in the end?</hi> In Hell all the Sugar will be melted off, wherein the Pill of your ≈øins and temptations is wrapt, and then the note you'l fing will be that of the Emperor, <hi>O quantum ob quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillum!</hi> O what an eternity of pain have I for an inch of plea≈øure, or an Ell of ≈øinful delight! As the Malefactor ≈øaid to his Neighbour, do≈øt thou envy me my Grapes that I have ≈øtolen? Alas, they I co≈øt me dear, I mu≈øt dye for them? Ah envy not at the plea≈øures of a poor ≈øinner, they'l co≈øt his ≈øoul dear one day; what doth <hi>Dives</hi> his Wine-cellar advantage him now in Hell, while he cries out for a <hi>Cup of cold water, and cannot have it:</hi> O Sirs, you cannot now conceive while you ≈øit in health and ea≈øe, what different thoughts you will then have of a holy, and unholy life, and with what gripes of Con≈øcience will your undone Souls, look back on a life of Mercy, thus ba≈øely, and blocki≈øhly ≈ølept away, dream'd and ≈øin'd away. I be≈øeech you then, and that for your own ≈øakes, that you would not for a few fle≈øhly plea≈øures, which are pa≈ø≈øing away, incur the torments of Hell, <hi>which ≈øhall never pa≈øs away.</hi>

            <p n="3">III. Thirdly, I be≈øeech you for <hi>Chri≈øts ≈øake.</hi> And me thinks when I beg of you in Chri≈øts name, and for Chri≈øts ≈øake, you ≈øhould not ≈øay nay; <hi>If you love me,</hi> ≈øaith Chri≈øt, <hi>keep my Commandements,</hi> Joh. 14.15.

            <p>Fir≈øt, I ≈øay his Command calls for it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Let your light ≈øhine before men, that they may ≈øee your good works;</hi> that is, lead ≈øuch convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing lives, that the world may witne≈øs and certifie with you, that you are certainly a choice Generation; <hi>a Seed which the Lord hath ble≈ø≈øed.</hi> Here's a Command you ≈øee, now where's your obedience? will you make Con≈øcience of it, or will you not? will you ≈øwear Allegiance to it, or will you not? ≈øhall it pa≈øs for an irrefragable Rule of Life, or ≈øhall it not.</p>
            <p>It was <hi>Pompey</hi>'s boa≈øt, that with a <hi>Word,</hi> or a <hi>Nod,</hi> he could a we his Souldiers to any thing; and ≈øhall God command, and go without? ≈øhall Gods word have le≈øs authority then <hi>Pompey</hi>'s?</p>
            <p>I read much of the blind obedience of the Papi≈øts to their Rulers, even in things ≈øcarce credible, but that them≈øelves have publi≈øht them.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Ma≈ø≈øeus</hi> a Franci≈øcan, tumbled him≈øelf in the dirt, and crawled like a Child, becau≈øe that St. <hi>Francis</hi> told him, <hi>That unle≈øs he became as a little Child, he could not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>

            <p>The Je≈øuites are ≈øo framed to Obedience, that whatever ≈øervice they are injoyned by their Superiours, though never ≈øo abominable, they mu≈øt accompli≈øh it. Yea, if the ble≈ø≈øed Virgin vouch≈øafe her pre≈øence to one of the brethren, if his Superiour call him, he mu≈øt pre≈øently break from her, and go at his bidding; although it be on a bloudy

            <p>What do I reckon the≈øe for, but to a≈ø≈øure you, that the≈øe who have paid ≈øuch homage to man, will ri≈øe up one day out of their Graves to condemn us, who are le≈øs careful in our obedience to God Almighty: They ≈øhut the eyes of Rea≈øon to obey their earthly Superiours, and we di≈øpute, if not deny our Allegiance to our Heavenly Law-giver.</p>
            <p>God bids us believe, and we di≈øtru≈øt; God bids us obey, and we di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; <hi>God bids us remember our Creator in the dayes of our Youth,</hi> and we forget him even in our age; God bids us learn of him, to be meek and lowly, and we learn of the Devil to be proud and haughty; God bids us <hi>be ≈øober and watch unto Prayer,</hi> and we ≈øurfeit with exce≈øs, and ≈øleep at Prayer; God bids us <hi>forbear, and forgive one another in love,</hi> and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and per≈øecute one another with much oppo≈øition and hatred. In a word, God bids us <hi>be content with what we have,</hi> and we unthankfully murmur for what we want.</p>
            <p>Ah ≈øinners, God ≈øees and hears you all this while, and his hand is ≈øetting down in the Table-book of his Remembrance all your unduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne≈øs and di≈øobedience, and when the Book ≈øhall be open'd, how think you will the≈øe Indictments be an≈øwer'd?</p>

O friends, ≈øtudy Chri≈øts life more, and you will ≈øooner learn to amend your own.</p>
            <p>Well, I'le conclude this Di≈øcour≈øe with one word of Coun≈øel. Is it Gods will that you ≈øhould be a holy people, then let your wills be ≈øo too, <hi>and be holy in all manner of conver≈øation.</hi>

            <p>The la≈øt words that Mr. <hi>Bolten</hi> ≈øpoke to his Children on his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, were the≈øe; <hi>I charge you my dear ones, as you will an≈øwer it at the day of Judgment, that you live ≈øo, as that you meet me not at that time in a ≈øtate of unregency.</hi>

            <p>Up then and be doing, thou know'≈øt not what a punctillio thy time is reduced unto; thou ha≈øt gone over ≈øome mens graves to day, and it may be, others may go over thine to morrow; Or, if God ≈øpare thee with life and health, yet if thou neglecte≈øt Gods call this Sabbath, God may neglect to call thee the next; It is well known how many merciful Me≈ø≈øages <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had brought him by <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> and what fair and frequent warnings he had to amend his life, but when all this would not do, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes</hi> took his leave, <hi>and he ≈øaw his face no more.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:62760:271"/>you, namely, <hi>That it's God's will you ≈øhould obey the Command, and live holy.</hi>

            <p>The next follows, which is this:</p>
            <p n="1">I. It's Gods will you ≈øhould bear the Cro≈øs, and ≈øuffer patiently, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17. It's better ≈øaith <hi>Peter,</hi> if the will of God be ≈øo, <hi>that ye ≈øuffer for well-doing,</hi> than for ill: Now, if the will of God be ≈øo ≈øometime, that you ≈øhould ≈øuffer, <hi>albeit for well-doing;</hi> than let your wills be ≈øo too, and quietly compo≈øe your ≈øelves to a ≈øuffering condition.</p>
            <p>It's ≈øaid of the <hi>I≈øraelites,</hi> that at the Commandment of the Lord they journeyed, and at the Commandment they pitched; whence it may be inferred, <hi>That it is God that a≈ø≈øigneth to us, and ordereth for us the ≈øeveral Vici≈ø≈øitudes of Fortune, and changes of Condition;</hi> our pitching here or there, is from a <hi>Providence,</hi> whether in a fair hou≈øe, or a foul, in a great living, or a ≈ømall, in a barren ≈øoil, or a fruitful, and where ever, or what ever it be, it is above our de≈øert, and therefore ≈øhould not fall below our thanks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> read of one, who was never the more proud, when dignified with <hi>Honour,</hi> nor never the le≈øs patient, when di≈øgraced with <hi>Slander:</hi> Oh this even temper, is an excellent temper, when a man can ≈øo eye his wants, as not to be puffed up with his Receipts, and ≈øo Eye his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, as not to be ca≈øt too much down in the ≈øen≈øe of his wants; And this is that frame of ≈øpirit, which <hi>I</hi> would fain have both my ≈øelf and you, to come up to; and therefore if God plea≈øe hereafter to make a Gap in thy E≈øtate, let not that open a Gap to di≈øcontent, but remember <hi>Jobs</hi> carriage in the like ca≈øe, and joyn with him in that penitential pro≈øtration of his, <hi>I will hear the indignation of the Lord, for I have ≈øinned again≈øt him.</hi> If God ≈øtrike thee with Dumbne≈øs, ≈øtrike not thou God again with thy Di≈øcontentedne≈øs, but remember ≈øpeechle≈øs <hi>Zachary,</hi> and be content; If God open the mouths of thy Enemies, or wicked Neighbours again≈øt thee, do not thou open thy mouth again≈øt them, but think oft on <hi>Davids</hi> words, <hi>I opened not my mouth,</hi> ≈øaid he, <hi>becau≈øe thou did≈øt it.</hi> Yet <hi>David</hi> opened not his mouth to recriminate them, nor vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate him≈øelf, but took all in good part, becau≈øe he knew that God did it. I ≈øhall now propound ≈øome con≈øiderations to contentment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Cro≈øs; I can only propound them, it's God that mu≈øt pro≈øper them to you.</p>

            </p>
            <p>O beloved, you know not how ≈øoon God may call for your comforts one after another, and bring you as he did his people <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> out of a fat Land, into a fami≈øhing Wilderne≈øs, where no water is, no comfort is; what will you do in ≈øuch a ca≈øe as this? If you plea≈øe, I'le tell you, when your hearts fail you, and your friends thus fail you, let not your hearts fail you, nor your faith fail you, for you have a faithful God which will never fail you, but will be in≈øtead of all things to you, from him≈øelf alone.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi> ≈øaid to <hi>Pharaoh, Without me God, will provide an an≈øwer for Pharaoh.</hi> So may I ≈øay in this ca≈øe; without ≈øilver, without gold, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fair hou≈øes and rich furniture, <hi>God can provide for the welfare of his people.</hi> Though your means be gone, yet your God is not gone; and if you cannot be contented now, it will argue that it was not God, but your <hi>means</hi> that did content you then.</p>
            <p>Well, this is the fir≈øt, Con≈øider God will be with thee in thy troubles, and that upon a two-fold account.</p>

            <p>And this is the ≈øecond Argument to work Contentment under the Cro≈øs; God will not only <hi>Come to you</hi> in your troubles, but you ≈øhall <hi>Go to God</hi> after your troubles, God will make your afflictions to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets into glory, and your Cro≈øs a Ladder to climb up to Heaven; and therefore fear not afflictions, they are not ≈øuch <hi>Bugbears</hi> as the fle≈øh fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieth them to be: Which ≈øeriou≈øly thought on, would be enough to make thy ≈øoul ambitious of ≈øuffering, ≈øaying as one did once, <hi>I am afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, till I be afflicted.</hi>

            <p>Ah! what lo≈øs can match this lo≈øs? <hi>and who≈øe ≈øufferings like his ≈øufferings?</hi> Do'≈øt thou ≈øigh under the ≈øen≈øe of thy grievance, thus, <hi>My ≈øoul is ≈øorrowful;</hi> But Chri≈øt went further, and ≈øaid, <hi>My ≈øoul is ≈øorrowful to death.</hi> Mat. 26.38.

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:275"/>Secondly, Your Cro≈øs is ea≈øie, if you compare it with the pain; of Hell, which you have de≈øerved. Ah! there's never a one of you but would be in Hell before to morrow, if God ≈øhould give you your due; there are many there for tho≈øe very ≈øins which you live in: <hi>Dives</hi> is in Hell for making an Idol of his Wealth; have none of you done ≈øo? <hi>Haman</hi> is in Hell for pride; and are you not proud? <hi>Sodom</hi> is in Hell for contempt of the Prophets of the Lord, and for neglecting the day of Peace, and the day of Grace; the day of Gods patience and ≈øtriving with them; and is not this <hi>Englands</hi> ≈øin at this very day? The old Word is burning in Hell, for burning in lu≈øt on Earth; and was this ≈øin ever more predominant than in this juncture of time? <hi>Herod</hi> hath been lying in Hell a thou≈øand and ≈øix hundred years, for taking <hi>John Bapti≈øts</hi> Head from him.</p>
            <p>Ah <hi>England! England!</hi> Is not this thy charge? Hath not this been thy practice the≈øe late years? And art thou not plung'd deep in thy own blood-guiltine≈øs? <hi>Herod</hi> did but cut one mans Head off, and he is gone to Hell for it: Oh what an Hell may e≈øt thou look for, who ha≈øt got ≈øo many Heads, and drunk the Blook of thou≈øands of the Saints, and faithful Servants of the mo≈øt High? What City is there wherein there is not ≈øome Noble Births, ≈øome of <hi>Englands</hi> Worthies Sacrificed to the bloody itch, and Bedlam Surges of a Civil War? <hi>(I had almo≈øt ≈øaid of an <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>ncivil Peace:)</hi> What Town is there wherein there is not ≈øome Families repeating over the Lamentations of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and ≈øaying, <hi>I am the man that hath ≈øeen affliction by the Rod of his wrath: Sion</hi> doth mourn, <hi>Judah</hi> is gone into captivity, <hi>the prophets ≈øigh, the ≈øheep are ≈øcattered, and wo is my ≈øoul becau≈øe of murderers!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How many of the dear Children of God are crying for bread? (for the powerful Preaching of the Word among≈øt them) and <hi>there is no bread to be given them, nor the plea≈øant voice of their faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters to be heared among≈øt them;</hi> and they left to lament over their ≈øilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Mini≈øters, as King <hi>Joa≈øh</hi> wept over the dying Prophet, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.14. <hi>O my Father, my Father, the Chariot of</hi> I≈ørael, <hi>and the hor≈øe-men thereof; Will not God vi≈øit for the≈øe? Will he not be avenged on ≈øuch a Nation as this?</hi> Yes, yes he will; <hi>I≈ørael</hi>'s woe, may be <hi>England</hi>'s
<pb facs="tcp:62760:275"/>warning, <hi>Amos</hi> 4. <hi>Thus will I do unto thee; and becau≈øe I will do thus unto thee, therefore prepare thy heart to meet thy God, O England.</hi> But this is a digre≈ø≈øion.</p>
            <p>That which I am to ≈øpeak to, is this, You are to bear the Cro≈øs contentedly, becau≈øe what ever you do <hi>Endure,</hi> it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to what you de≈øerve, or to what the damned in Hell <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Hell there is variety of torments, and extremity of torments, and eternity of torments; not one way, but a thou≈øand wayes to make a <hi>poor</hi> ≈øoul mi≈øerable, everla≈øtingly mi≈øerable? And who can bear variety? Who can bear Eternity? Who can bear Eternity of torments? Yet all this you mu≈øt bear, if ever it be your lot to lie in Hell.</p>
            <p>Here it may be you want one mercy, but ble≈ø≈øed be God you have another in lieu of it; you want health, but you want not friends; you want money, but you want not a Chri≈øt; you want an E≈øtate, but you want not a contented mind; though your life be not ab≈øolutely made up of comforts, which is your mi≈øery; yet it is not altogether compo≈øed of cro≈ø≈øes; and is not this a Mercy?</p>
            <p>And thus is your life <hi>checqu'rd</hi> with <hi>blacks</hi> and <hi>whites,</hi> ≈øo that you have never ≈øuch cau≈øe of Mourning, but withall you have ≈øome ju≈øt ground of rejoycing; but in Hell there's nothing to be ≈øeen, but objects of ≈øorrow; and nothing to be heard except inducements to grief; not one merry day, and one ≈øad, not one hour of pain, and another of ea≈øe; not one cro≈øs, and one comfort; but all cro≈ø≈øes and cur≈øes do meet there like lines in their proper center. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare now your ≈øufferings with the ≈øufferings of <hi>Hell,</hi> and let this quiet you.</p>
            <p>That School-boy thinks he gets well off, when de≈øerving a Rod, he e≈øcapes with a Reproof: What a mercy then may you count it, that when you de≈øerve a <hi>Cur≈øe</hi> from Chri≈øt, you e≈øcape with the <hi>Cre≈øs</hi> of Chri≈øt; afflicted on Earth, when you might ju≈øtly be tormented in <hi>Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:276"/>Think of it then, are you corrected? <hi>It's the Lords mercy that you are not con≈øumed.</hi> Hath God taken away your health from you? it's well you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcape ≈øo, he might have taken away your life from you, and your Chri≈øt from you, and where had you been then?</p>
            <p>In a word, how much ≈øoever God takes from you, it's le≈øs then you owe him; and how little ≈øoever he leaves you, it's more than he owes you; therefore in ≈øtead of murmuring that your condition is ≈øo ill, ble≈øs God that it is no wor≈øe, ≈øaying with <hi>Ezra, Ez.</hi> 9.13. <hi>Thou, O Lord, ha≈øt puni≈øht us le≈øs than our Iniquities have de≈øerved.</hi>

            <list>
               <item>1. A <hi>Precept,</hi> holding forth the duty and employment of a Chri≈øtian: <hi>Tho≈øe things which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and ≈øeen in me, do.</hi>
               </item>

            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> For the <hi>Precept;</hi> it holds forth the duty an employment of a Chri≈øtian, and that is, to live up to his knowledge, to tran≈øcribe the Law of God into his life, and to practice with all diligence what ever he hath learned, and heard, and received from the Lord, whether by precept or example.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> For the <hi>Promi≈øe;</hi> it holds forth the priviledge and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of a Chri≈øtian, and that is, that doing what he knows and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øing him≈øelf in the practi≈øe of what he hath both <hi>heard, and learned, and received from the Lord,</hi> he is ≈øure to have God's pre≈øence with him, not only in regard of his E≈ø≈øence, for ≈øo he is every where, and with every man pre≈øent; neither can he be otherwi≈øe; but al≈øo in regard of his grace and ≈øavour.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>Tho≈øe that walk in obedience with God, he will always be graciou≈øly pre≈øent with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The God of Peace will vouch≈øafe his gracious pre≈øence to all tho≈øe who have heard, received and learned, whether by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept or Example, the Truth as it is in Je≈øus, are careful to do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
            <p>Such as yield obedience to God's holy Will, endeavouring to practice what they have heard, and to live up to the Truths they have learned, ≈øhall never be for≈øaken, but God will always afford them his gracious pre≈øence.</p>
            <p>If any man practice what he knows, (provided that he know the Truth as it is in <hi>Je≈øus</hi>) if any man walk in obedience with God, endeavouring to expre≈øs what he hath heard, and learned, and received from him, by
<pb facs="tcp:62760:277"/>the holine≈øs of his life and conver≈øation; the Lord will be graciou≈øly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent with that man, as a Pilot to guide him as a Rock to ≈øu≈øtain him, and as a Fountain of living water, to mini≈øter all fulne≈øs to him.</p>
            <p>In the pro≈øecution of this Doctrine, having ≈øhewed you how the Lord will be pre≈øent with them that walk in obedience with him; I ≈øhall give you the Rea≈øons evincing it, and ≈øo come to the practical improvement of the whole, by way of U≈øe and Application.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Therefore by way of Explication; The Lord will be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly pre≈øent with tho≈øe that walk in obedience with him, the≈øe eight wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By way of gracious Acceptation: Never did any man yet ≈øtudy to approve him≈øelf to God, in a way of dutiful obedience, but the Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo was pre≈øent with him in a way of gracious acceptance. A wicked man, not ≈øtudying obedience to God, finds no acceptance with him in ought that he doth; the ≈øighs of a wicked man are un≈øavoury, his ≈øolemn Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is as dung, and his prayers are abominable; God will not come near him, for his breath is infectious. But for tho≈øe that live up to their knowledge, God highly favours them, and takes all that they do in good part.</p>
            <p>Not a good word falls from their lips, but is recorded, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. Not a tear drops from their eyes, but 'tis taken up and bottled, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 56.8. Their weak prayers ≈øound like melody, their broken ≈øighs ≈ømell like Incen≈øe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.21. and their very ≈øtammerings ≈øeem Rhetorical, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14.</p>
            <p>When all the gli≈øtering ≈øhews of hypocrites, evaporate and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, yet they that ≈øtudy to walk in obedience with God, are crowned with acceptation.</p>
            <p>We oftentimes come to God with broken pravers; but if we be ≈øuch as make it our care to practice what we have heard, and learned, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, God ≈øpell can out our meaning and will take our weak performances as a mo≈øt grateful pre≈øent, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By way of Direction: The Pilot by his pre≈øence in the Ship, and by his Skill and Activity, turns the Rudder of the Ships, and guides the cour≈øe thereof, ≈øteering a right cour≈øe towards the de≈øired Haven: So God as a ≈øpiritual Pilot, is pre≈øent in the Ship of every obedient Soul, guiding it by his Coun≈øel, and enabling,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:278"/>it by the direction and guidance of his own holy ≈øpirit, to ≈øteer a right cour≈øe to the Haven of Eternal Re≈øt. By nature we under≈øtand not the things of the Spirit of God, neither indeed can we, becau≈øe they are ≈øpiritually di≈øcerned; but, ≈øaith Chri≈øt, if any man will do his will, he ≈øhall know of the Doctrine, whether it be of God, <hi>John</hi> 7.17. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is the Pilot, to guide us in our obedience; if Zeal be not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to knowledge, it's will-wor≈øhip; and there is no better way to become knowing, than by doing and practi≈øing what we have already learned.</p>
            <p>The di≈øobedient and ungodly are in darkne≈øs until now; neither can they di≈øcern as they ought, what concerns their everla≈øting peace; but the ≈øecret of the Lord is with them that fear him, endeavouring to do what they know; and he will teach them the way that they ≈øhould choo≈øe, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 25 12, 14.</p>
            <p>Oh then, how great is this priviledge, that God will re≈øolve our doubts, acquaint us what is his Will, and give his Spirit to lead us into all nece≈ø≈øary Truths, when we make it our care to an≈øwer our knowledge with ≈øuitable practi≈øe! He that doth not what he knows, ≈øhall not ≈øhortly know what to do; but he who≈øe life is corre≈øpondent to his light, God will never leave to ≈øit in Egyptian dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By way of pre≈øervation; God is always pre≈øent with tho≈øe to keep them from evil, who ≈øtudy obedience to him in that which is good. If God's people ab≈øtain from drunkenne≈øs, ≈øwearing, Idolatry, and the like abominable impieties, which inevitably drown the ≈øoul in perdition, let them not rob the Lord of his glory, in a≈øcribing it to the goodne≈øs of their natures, but let them ingeniou≈øly acknowledge it to proceed from the goodne≈øs of God, that pre≈øerves them more than others, and many times prevents their falling into tho≈øe fins which by nature they were prone to, as well as the re≈øt.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>David</hi> was kept from murdering <hi>Nabal; Noah</hi> from partaking with the old world in their wickedne≈øs; <hi>Lot</hi> from following after the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations of <hi>Sodom; Jo≈øeph</hi> from con≈øenting to the lude inticements of his impudent Mi≈øtris; and tho≈øe three Jewi≈øh Worthies, from falling down to wor≈øhip before the golden Image which <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> King of <hi>Babylon</hi> had ≈øet up, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.16, 18.</p>

            <p>Secondly, Thus I have ≈øhewed you how God is pre≈øent with tho≈øe that live up to their knowledge: As an Altar of Perfume, cau≈øing them to find acceptance, both in their per≈øons and performances with him≈øelf As the Sun which gives them light in darkne≈øs, as a wall of fire which defends them in the a≈ø≈øaults of all their Enemies; as a fountain of living water; communicating ≈øtreams to refre≈øh them, when all their Ve≈ø≈øels, like <hi>Hagars,</hi> prove empty bottles; as an Ack to hide them in from the deluge of all di≈øtre≈ø≈øes; and as a living Rock, ≈øu≈øtaining them under all their pre≈ø≈øures or burdens, how many or great ≈øoever. Come we now therefore, to give you the Rea≈øons, why God wil vouch≈øafe to be graciou≈øly pre≈øent with them, who walk in obedience with him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what they have heard, received, and learned, whether by precept or example.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Becau≈øe tho≈øe that are pre≈øent with God in a way of obedience, the Lord is engaged by promi≈øe, to be graciou≈øly pre≈øent with them,</hi> 2 Chron. 15.2. <hi>Hearye me, A≈øa, and all Judah, and Benjamin, the Lord is with you, whil≈øt you are with him.</hi> Tho≈øe that are pre≈øent with God in a way of Duty, he hath here promi≈øed to be pre≈øent with them in a way of Grace and Mercy.</p>
            <p>'Tis our Duty indeed, to keep clo≈øe to God, and to walk in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with him, though after all he ≈øhould reject us, and give us no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: But, for but better encouragement, God ≈øweetens his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands with promi≈øes, tying our Work and our Wages, our Duty and Reward together.</p>
            <p>So, that pre≈øent with God in a way of obedience, according to the condition, he cannot but be graciou≈øly pre≈øent with us, according to the mind and true intent of the promi≈øe: <hi>For the Lord is not a man that he ≈øhould lye, nor the Son of man, that he ≈øhould repent,</hi> Numb. 23.19.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Becau≈øe, ≈øuch as walk in obedience with God, do engage him to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent with them, by depending fiducially upon him.</hi> Tru≈øt, is a kind of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
<pb facs="tcp:62760:280"/>when there is no promi≈øe: but what is it to tru≈øt upon God, who hath made ≈øo many promi≈øes of being pre≈øent with tho≈øe that keep clo≈øe to him.</p>
            <p>Common ingenuity will teach us to ≈øtand by tho≈øe that put confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in us; And will not the goodne≈øs of God much more incline him to be graciou≈øly pre≈øent with his own people, who place their whole tru≈øt and affiance to him?</p>

            <p>Though there were nothing to move him to make ≈øuch his people, before he did; yet there is ≈øomething that may engage him never to for≈øake, but to be graciou≈øly pre≈øent with them, now he hath made them his people; and that is, his propriety in them, becau≈øe they are his people.</p>
            <p>Hath he cho≈øen us, and will he again reprobate us? Hath he ≈øet us apart for him≈øelf, and will he ca≈øt us off? Hath he purcha≈øed us, and will he reject his own purcha≈øe? Hath he married us to him≈øelf, and will he not cohabit with us, but in≈øtead thereof, be divorced from us, notwith≈øtanding he hath told us, he hates putting away? <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.16. Hath he, in a word, of his own good plea≈øure, made us his people, and will he repent of his choice, with drawing from us, in≈øtead of being graciou≈øly pre≈øent with us? 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12 27.</p>
            <p n="4">And la≈øtly, <hi>Becau≈øe God is concerned in point of Honour to be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly pre≈øent with them;</hi> Such ≈øtand by God a≈ø≈øerting his intere≈øt and Glory in the world; And is he not then concerned, in point of Honour to ≈øt and by them?</p>
            <p>To practi≈øe <hi>what we have heard, and received, and learned of God,</hi> is to run the hazard of reproach, di≈øgrace, and per≈øecution in the world: Now all this being done upon Gods account, and in obedience to him, How can it ≈øtand with his Honour, to ≈øtand aloof, and not to be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly pre≈øent with us in the mid≈øt of ≈øo many dangers?

            <p n="3">3 Con≈øider, <hi>Such is the pre≈øence of God with tho≈øe that walk in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with him, that it can quiet their ≈øouls, turning every ≈øtorm that ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, into a ble≈ø≈øed calm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the heart is full of doubts and di≈øtre≈ø≈øes, accu≈øed by the Law, pur≈øued by the Adver≈øary, and condemned by it ≈øelf; then doth God by his gracious pre≈øence ≈øtill the raging of the ≈øea, give quiet to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience, and lay the ≈øtorm.</p>
            <p>Nothing but the brea≈øt will quiet the child; ≈øo nothing but
<pb facs="tcp:62760:283"/>the brea≈øts of God's gracious pre≈øence can quiet a di≈øtre≈ø≈øed ≈øoul, <hi>Rom</hi> 5.1.</p>
            <p>Would you therefore be at peace, and have quiet in your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øciences? would you have a ≈øweet calm, and a ≈øabbath of re≈øt from all your ≈øpiritual agonies? Walk then in obedience with God, endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to practi≈øe what you know, that he by his pre≈øence may work your de≈øire.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Con≈øider, <hi>Such is the pre≈øence of God with all that obey him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what they have heard, and learned, and received, that nothing can intercept it, nor withhold it from them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If they go up to Heaven in pro≈øperity, God is there, making all their enjoyments conduce to their everla≈øting advantage; if they be forced to make their bed in hell and lie down in ≈øorrow, God al≈øo is there, turning their ≈øorrow into joy; if they be glad to take the wings of the morning<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and to fly for their lives into the uttermo≈øt parts of the earth, God is al≈øo there, bringing them back at length out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Land of their Captivity, into <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh then, if any thing can make you obedient; let the hope of God's gracious pre≈øence prevail with you to be ≈øo; your Honors, your Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, your Friends, and all your creature comforts may be ea≈øily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held; the≈øe are but as the ≈øhining of the Sun, which every di≈øconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted cloud may intercept: But if you walk in obedience with God, there is nothing can intercept his pre≈øence; nor hinder you from having communion with him.

            <p>Such is the power of God's gracious pre≈øence, that it takes away the bitterne≈øs of afflictions from all that walk in obedience with him, gives them honey out of the beily of Lyons meat out of the Eater, and ≈øweet out of ≈øowr.</p>
            <p>If then you de≈øire to ≈øee light in darkne≈øs, to have your Pri≈øon turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a Paradi≈øe, and the flames of Martyrdom into a bed of Spices; See then that you walk in obedience with God according to what you have heard, and learned, and received.</p>
            <p>Pro≈øperity without God's pre≈øence is full of trouble; but trouble with the pre≈øence of God is full of comfort.</p>

            <p>Outward comforts do ≈øooner cloy than chear; and ≈øooner weary than fill; they can no more ≈øatisfie the heart, than a Triangle can fill a Circle: But when once God comes and vouch≈øafes his gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence,

            <p>God may (indeed) withdraw the light of his countenance for a time; but totally, and for ever, he will never de≈øert tho≈øe that walk in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience with him.</p>
            <p>All things without God are full of vanity and change; onely the Lord will never utterly ab≈øent him≈øelf from us, if once he be graciou≈øly pre≈øent with us: He is a faithful Friend, loving at all times; his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is a Sun that knows no ≈øetting: and his pre≈øence a Well of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, ≈øpringing up to eternal Life, <hi>John</hi> 4.14 &amp; 13.1.</p>
            <p>So that if you regard a Trea≈øure that ≈øhall never be taken from you, that favour which ≈øhall never end in frowns, make ≈øure of God's gracious pre≈øence, by walking in obedience with him, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what you have heard, and learned, and received from him.</p>

            <p>Are we in danger? this is a ≈øhield: Are we di≈øcon≈øolate? this is a Sun : If in a word) we be pur≈øued by any calamity, this is like the munition of Rocks, an hiding-place again≈øt the ≈øtorm, and a Tower wherein we may find ≈øafety.</p>
            <p>If then God's gracious pre≈øence be thus proper to our wants, and ≈øo ≈øuitable to all our nece≈ø≈øities, how ought we to labour for it, by walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in obedience with him, according to what we have heard, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and received from him.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And la≈øtly, <hi>Such is the pre≈øence of God with tho≈øe that obey him,

            </p>
            <p>God's people they go from Communion to Communion; from Communion with God in a ≈øtate of grace, to Communion with God in a ≈øtate of glory. For with whom≈øoever God is graciou≈øly pre≈øent here, they ≈øhall hereafter enjoy his bli≈øsful, ≈øoul-ravi≈øhing, and beatifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal pre≈øence to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>If then you de≈øire to be with the Lord for ever, where you ≈øhall ≈øee his glory, enjoy his pre≈øence, and be ≈øatisfied with plea≈øures at his tight hand for evermore; then ≈øee that you walk in obedience before him. For tho≈øe onely ≈øhall enjoy God's pre≈øence in a ≈øtate of glory, with whom he is now pre≈øent in a ≈øtate of grace. There is no commencing Saints, either Militant on Earth, or Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant in Heaven <hi>per Saltum:</hi> If we draw not nigh to God in a way of obedience here, we mu≈øt hereafter be puni≈øhed with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la≈øting de≈øtruction from his pre≈øence, and from the glory of his Power.</p>
            <p>Thus by Divine a≈ø≈øi≈øtance I have ≈øhewed you the excellency of Gods pre≈øence, with all ≈øuch as obey him according to what they have heard, and learned, and received from him: Now then, do not deprive your ≈øelves of ≈øo glorious a privilege, but ≈øee that henceforth you walk in obedience with God, giving diligence to practi≈øe tho≈øe things you have learned.</p>
            <p>But that you may not at length be di≈øappointed, neither find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God graciou≈øly pre≈øent with you here, nor enjoying his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence in glory hereafter; be ≈øure that in doing what you have heard, learned and received, you ob≈øerve the≈øe following dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Be ≈øure that of all which you have heard, and learned and received, tither of me or of any other, you practice that onely which you find to be of God, and according to the unerring Rule of his Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have one Heavenly King, and mu≈øt therefore ob≈øerve one Law; we have one God, and mu≈øt Wor≈øhip by one Rule; We have one Shepheard, and mu≈øt be commanded by one Voice: We have (in a word) one Head, and mu≈øt follow upon that account one direction.</p>
            <p>All that builded <hi>Noah's</hi> Ark, builded by one pattern; ≈øo all that intend to build them≈øelves an Heavenly and Spiritual Hou≈øe to GOD, mu≈øt build by one Rule. All <hi>I≈ørael</hi> travelled to the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> by the light of one fiery Pillar: So all that will travel
<pb facs="tcp:62760:285"/>to the Heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> of God's gracious pre≈øence, mu≈øt make his Word a <hi>light to their feet, and a lanthorn to their paths.</hi> All the pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øengers in a Ship ≈øail by one Compa≈øs; ≈øo all that will fteer a right cour≈øe to the Haven of Eternal Re≈øt, mu≈øt keep clo≈øe to the unerring Rule of Gods Word, as their onely Compa≈øs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.16.</p>
            <p>For it's Gods Prerogative to pre≈øcribe, and mans duty to conform; our ≈øervice is no ≈øervice, not will God be pre≈øent with us in any thing that we do, farther then we <hi>have heard, and learned, and received it from him,</hi> Mat. 15.9.</p>
            <p>Let then every man among≈øt you that de≈øires Gods pre≈øence, either in grace here, or in glory hereafter, be like tho≈øe noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining the ground of their Faith, and obedience. Oh, do not offer to God a ≈øacrifice without eyes; your Religion mu≈øt be Scripture-Religion, and all your obedience commanded therein, would you ever be accepted of God in what you do.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Be ≈øure that what ever you have heard, received and learned, you do it cordially without di≈ø≈øembling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The obedience of the life without, when integrity of heart, and the life of grace is wanting within, finds no acceptance with God, nor will he ever be graciou≈øly pre≈øent with tho≈øe who onely draw nigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by an external conformity.</p>
            <p>Obedience without the heart, and to practi≈øe what we have heard, and learned, and received, but not in ≈øincerity, will bring neither glory to God, nor comfort to us.</p>
            <p>Do not then di≈ø≈øemble any longer with the God of Heaven: Oh be not indu≈øtrious to plot your own death, and through your hypocri≈øie go to Hell in the way of duty; but what ever you have heard, what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you have learned, what ever you have received, be ≈øure that you do it heartily as unto God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Be ≈øure that what ever you have heard, and learned, and received, you do it univerfally, without any re≈øervation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>True obedience is univer≈øal; doing many things, and neglecting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, will not ≈øave; one leak in the ≈øhip of thy Soul, is enough to ≈øink it in eternal perdition, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 119.</p>
            <p>The hypocrite will walk in ≈øome of Gods Statutes; but with <hi>David</hi> you mu≈øt have <hi>re≈øpect to all his Commandments,</hi> if you ever de≈øire the Lord to be pre≈øent with you as he was with <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every duty (therefore) commanded, be ≈øure that you do it; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ≈øin forbidden, be ≈øure that you ≈øhun it as Hell it ≈øelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:285"/>Many whol≈øom Doctrines have been taught, and many ≈øoul-≈øaving Truths have been made known among you; well, of all that you ever heard, received and learned, let nothing fall to the ground, but bring all into practice, would you ever enjoy Gods gracious pre≈øence.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And la≈øtly, <hi>Of all that you have heard, and learned, and received from God, be ≈øure that you do it con≈øtantly, without going over. The Lord is with you</hi> (≈øaith the Prophet, ≈øpeaking to <hi>A≈øa</hi> and all <hi>Juda</hi>) <hi>while ye are with him; if ye ≈øeek him, he will be found of you, but if you for≈øake him, he will al≈øo for≈øake you,</hi> 2 Chron. 15.2.</p>
            <p>If we de≈øire that God ≈øhould always be pre≈øent with us in a way of Mercy, we mu≈øt ≈øtill ≈øtrive to be pre≈øent with him in a way of duty; and if we would not have God ca≈øt us off, and for≈øake us in the end, we mu≈øt be careful not to for≈øake him, but to hold on with God in a way of obedience to the end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that ≈øhall endure to the end</hi> (≈øaith Chri≈øt) <hi>the ≈øame ≈øhall be ≈øaved,</hi> Matth. 24.13. As God condemns no man before he ≈øins, ≈øo neither will he crown any man before he overcomes. We mu≈øt Conquer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can Triumph; win the garland before we can wear it, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Crown of Eternal Communion with God in glory, <hi>by patient continuance in well-doing,</hi> Rom. 2.8.</p>
            <p>Let me then, once for all (as a lover of your ≈øouls) be≈øeech you what ever you have heard, what ever you have learned, whatever you have received from the Lord, that you practi≈øe it, and that to the end. Oh remember what you have heard, give diligence to practi≈øe what you have learned, and whatever you have received from the Lord, whether concerning principles of Faith, or precepts of Life, be ≈øure that you hold it fa≈øt, that no man take your Crown, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.3.</p>
            <p>Knowledg without an an≈øwerable practice, will not avail you; and the practice of what you know, without per≈øeverance therein to the end, will but aggravate your condemnation, and ≈øerve to ≈øink you the deeper in the pit of eternal perdition, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21.</p>
            <p>Take heed therefore that you be not carried away with the error of the wicked; let no thought ari≈øe within you of departing from the living God, but pre≈øs on towards the Mark, hold fa≈øt your Integrity, per≈øevere in obedience to God, according to what you have heard, and learned, and received from the Lord, and ≈øee that you break through all di≈øcouragements for communion with him.</p>
            <p>In God you have a living Spring when all your bottles are empty; in him you have a ≈øure Sanctuary, when all your Refuges and hiding-places
<pb facs="tcp:62760:286"/>in the World are laid level with the ground; in him you have a glorious Sun, when all the blazing ≈øtars of your creature comforts are extingui≈øh'd, and di≈øappear: In him (to be ≈øhort) you ≈øhall find everla≈øting friend≈øhip, when all your friends according to the fle≈øh, are put to perpetual ≈øilence in the grave.</p>
            <p>Oh then, be careful that you cleave to this God, that you repo≈øe your ≈øelves wholly upon him, and that you con≈øtantly (without giving over) walk in obedience with him, according to what you have heard, and learned, and received; that ≈øo enjoying God's gracious pre≈øence here in a ≈øtate of grace, you may hereafter enjoy the pre≈øential, ≈øoul-≈øatisfying, and open vi≈øion of him≈øelf in a ≈øtate of glory.</p>

            <p>THe≈øe Words, with the foregoing ver≈øes, I have in≈øi≈øted largely upon already. And in the Words I told you, there is,</p>

            </p>
            <p>I have told you what is meant by Candle≈øtick. A Candle≈øtick I told you ≈øignifies the Church of God, or a Company, or a Society of people met together to wor≈øhip God in Spirit and in Truth. As if he ≈øhould ≈øay, I will ≈ømite thy Shepherds, and ≈øcatter thy Flocks; I will take away mighty Lights, and I will leave thee in <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkne≈øs; I will cut off my Ordinances, which are my golden Pipes to convey the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Life unto you.</p>
            <p>But you will ≈øay, <hi>Why is the Lord ≈øo angry with Ephe≈øus?</hi>

            <p>It is, Becau≈øe of the Churches ≈øins; It is, becau≈øe thou ha≈øt not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me as once thou did≈øt. Want of love to Chri≈øt is a ≈øin that de≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to be unchurched; that de≈øerveth that God ≈øhould take away your

            <p>I have told you the greatne≈øs of the ≈øins that his Church was guilty of. I have likewi≈øe ≈øhewed you what a great Cur≈øe it is for the Lord to take away the Go≈øpel from a Nation; I told you that it is a big-bellied Cur≈øe; it is a cur≈øe that hath a great many other cur≈øe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowelled up in it.</p>
            <p>I told you when the Go≈øpel goes, God goes; and when God goes, Chri≈øt goes; and when Chri≈øt goes, the mini≈øtring Angels of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant go, the Candle≈øtick goes, and the Lights they go along with it.</p>
            <p>What then follows, when God goes? Then the Devil he comes, yea, legions of Devils come; and then there follows the Plague, Pe≈øtilence, Famine, Sword, and all other manner of evils. God doth not go alone, neither doth God remove his Candle≈øtick alone. I do not tell you that God threatens you to pull down all your Lights, I would not terrifie you by telling you that God is a departing from you, when he puts out ≈øome of your Lights: But yet I mu≈øt needs tell you, that when God doth deprive you of ≈øo many hundreds, of as Pious, and as Laborious, and as Learned (≈øome of them) as any are in the Vineyard; I ≈øay, when God deals thus by you, I cannot think that it is in mercy to you, but in judgement.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> is a great People, and there are many poor ≈øouls in it, that are as Fire-brands in the fire, that have great need to be pluckt out; and as there are, ble≈ø≈øed be God, many eminent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters at this day in <hi>England,</hi> to ≈ønatch ≈øuch poor ≈øouls, as fire brands out of the fire; Yet I ≈øay, that where there is one, we have need of ten.</p>
            <p>But though our di≈øea≈øe is dangerous, yet it is not de≈øperate: there is one way for us to prevent tho≈øe heavy judgements that the Lord doth
<pb facs="tcp:62760:287"/>threaten to inflict upon us; and that is by Repentance; by a ≈øerious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting of the ≈øins pa≈øt of our lives, and to amend what hath been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øs in us.</p>
            <p>I ≈øhall now come to make ≈øome Application of what I have formerly delivered unto you.</p>

            <p>In the fir≈øt place, Is this a Truth, That Repentance is the only way and means to prevent the Judgements of God, that are threatned again≈øt a People by God for ≈øin. Then fir≈øt of all, <hi>I would have you to ob≈øerve the cur≈øed nature of this cur≈øed thing, called ≈øin: Sin mu≈øt be repented of, or it will de≈øtroy us, it will de≈øtroy our bodies, it will de≈øtroy our ≈øouls, it will de≈øtroy our Kingdom: this is the cur≈øed nature of this thing called ≈øin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My beloved, I think it is one of the harde≈øt things that is, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand the exceeding ≈øinfulne≈øs of ≈øin, to under≈øtand that deadly Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon that is in it; it is for want of the true knowledge of it, that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth that deadne≈øs of heart that you ≈øo much groin under. Thus you ≈øee that ≈øin (that thing which we ≈øo much ≈ølight) what a terrible thing it is. Alas, what think many of us of a vain word, or an idle thought, or ≈øwearing an Oath: what a trifling thing it is to neglect Prayer.</p>
            <p>But let me ask you, that think ≈øin to be ≈øo ≈ølight a matter, What is the rea≈øon that God is ≈øo angry that he made man? What is the rea≈øon that many a ≈øinful Church, hath made God repent that ever he made them a Church? I ≈øay therefore<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> con≈øider the exceeding venom that there is in ≈øin: Oh take heed of ≈øin, it is a Child that although it be conceived in joy, yet it ≈øhall bring forth ≈øorrow in the end. Cur≈øed be the day that ever ≈øin was born into the world. Sin, it is ≈øo vile a thing, that it makes God for to cry out at it, and Je≈øus Chri≈øt for to cry out at it, and makes them to ≈øay, they will be gone: If you continue in your ≈øins, I will take away my Mini≈øters, and leave you in darkne≈øs.</p>
            <p>Tu≈øh, ≈øay you, what is ≈øin? I ≈øay, it is the venom and poy≈øon of our natures, it is that which is, as the hand to un≈øheath the ≈øword, and to thru≈øt it into our own bowels. Sin, it is as a mil≈øtone that is tied about our necks, that will pull us both ≈øoul and body into the bottom of that Sea of the wrath of God, from whence there will be no recovery; ≈øin is a Plague that will follow our po≈øterity after we are gone out of this world; ≈øin, it is a worm upon the Tree of life, that eats up the fruit of it; ≈øin it is that, which makes the Lord to take away the Go≈øpel from among≈øt us; ≈øin it is a devili≈øh charm within us, that drives away God, and Chri≈øt, and the Go≈øpel from among≈øt us: This is the evil of that cur≈øed thing called ≈øin. Oh, do not you make a liitle matter of it: do
<pb facs="tcp:62760:288"/>not you ≈øay, when you have been drunk, what harm is there that I have drunk a cup too much? do not ≈øay, what harm is there in my telling a lye, or ≈øwearing an oath? Oh my beloved, what a ≈øad thing is this ≈øin, that it ≈øhould cau≈øe God for to throw Angels out of Heaven into Hell! Pride ca≈øt Angels into Hel; take heed it doth not ≈øo by you. Sin made God to de≈øtroy all the old world; ≈øin made God to repent that he had made the world; ≈øin made God for to burn <hi>Sodom</hi> &amp; <hi>Gomorah;</hi> ≈øin made God for to threaten <hi>Ephe≈øus</hi> to remove hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>candle≈øtick</hi> from among them.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ≈øay, do not think ≈øin to be a ≈ømall matter; make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience of the lea≈øt of ≈øins; believe God, that it is a vile thing; con≈øider with thy ≈øelf what a vain labour this labour of ≈øin is; it is a vain trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble≈øome work; when you commit it, you mu≈øt re≈øolve for to die the death, or to undo it again. Sin, it may well be called the <hi>Labour in vain.</hi> When thou art a doing any thing that is evil, thou mu≈øt repent of it, or el≈øe it will undo thee. Sin is a long thred of the ≈øinners ≈øpinning, that when he hath ≈øpun it out he mu≈øt ≈øit down in ≈øorrow, and labour to undo his work again.</p>
            <p>While thou art a ≈øinning, I can compare it to nothing better, than to the journey that <hi>Jo≈øeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> made to <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> and left <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Chri≈øt</hi> behind them.</p>
            <p>My beloved, it is a ≈øad journeying without Chri≈øt in your company: when you go on in ≈øin, you mu≈øt return again, or el≈øe you will lo≈øe your ≈øouls. This I ≈øay is the <hi>labour in Vain</hi> of ≈øinners, they are doing a work that they mu≈øt undo again; they are running a race that they mu≈øt run back again, or el≈øe it will undo them You are gathering up of ≈øticks that will help to burn you; you are whetting a knife that mu≈øt cut your own throats; you are ≈øpinning a thred that mu≈øt hang you.</p>
            <p>Oh my beloved, little do you think that you are doing this, when you are ≈øinning! Do not you ≈øay therefore, that ≈øin is a little matter, for God will damn thee ≈øoul and body for it: he that will damn thee for lying, he that will damn thee for neglect of praying, he doth think that the≈øe ≈øins are great matters: Will you lay the≈øe things to heart? I ≈øhall ≈øpeak but a few words more, and I ≈øhall have done, and God knowes whether ever I ≈øhall ≈øpeak to you any more.</p>
            <p>I ≈øay, take heed of ≈øin, and do not you go away with light thoughts of it.</p>

            <p>And now, I be≈øeech you, do not you flatter your ≈øelves in your wicked ≈øinful cour≈øes; If you do then I ≈øay, take heed that God doth not ≈øend his Judgments upon you: And if you repent not, doubtle≈øs God will bring ≈øome Plague upon <hi>England,</hi> ere it be long.</p>
            <p>Con≈øider this, O <hi>England,</hi> and do not provoke God to depart from you; For, if you repent of your Sins, you may expect to live quietly in the Land of your Nativity, and go to your death beds in peace and re≈øt: But if you will not repent of your ≈øins, then, I ≈øay, expect nothing but Cur≈øings in≈øtead of Ble≈ø≈øings from God: If you will repent, do it to day; God knows how long it may be before you have ≈øuch another day.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The welfare of your ≈øouls depends upon it, the welfare of the Church depends upon it; the welfare of three Kingdoms depends upon it.</p>
            <p>My beloved, it is no trifling now, <hi>Will you repent,</hi> I ask you? It may be hereafter God will give you up to hardne≈øs of heart, and blindne≈øs of mind; and if you go on in your wickedne≈øs, Hell will follow after it.</p>
            <p>Well, I ≈øay, <hi>Will you repent?</hi> I ask you the Que≈øtion, and I ask you no other Que≈øtion than I have asked my own ≈øelf, before I came into this place.

            <p>That God is angry with you, it is plain, for God would never el≈øe have taken away his Mini≈øters from among you.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but God hath made u≈øe of ≈øome of tho≈øe that are to ≈øpeak no more in the <hi>Name of Je≈øus,</hi> to the ≈ønatching of you as fire brands out of the fire; and in bringing you from the kingdome of Satan, unto the Kingdom of the Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt</p>

If the damned in Hell were delivered out of Hell, they would ≈øin again: if they lived eternally, they would ≈øin eternally. But I am not ≈øpeaking to men in hell, nor to women in hell, but I ≈øpeak to you that are here upon earth.</p>
            <p>But there are a people to whom the day of Grace is ≈øet while they live to whom the Sun of Righteou≈øne≈øs is ≈øet, and their day is filled up with darkne≈øs: I look upon the Heathen as ≈øuch, <hi>I</hi> look upon the <hi>Jews</hi> as ≈øuch I look upon the <hi>Turks</hi> as ≈øuch: I dare not ≈øay of any man or woman living, that can come within the hearing of a Sermon, that God hath given any one up to ≈øuch a reprobate mind.</p>
            <p>Now my beloved, if it be not thus with any of you, that your day of Grace is not pa≈øt, as I am confident it is not, Then I be≈øeech you in the Name and Fear of God, that you would repent. The dying words of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men and women, do u≈øually prevail with tho≈øe that hear them: The dying words of Fathers and Mothers, do u≈øe to prevail with their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: My beloved, if you have any love to God, if you have any love to your ≈øouls, remember my la≈øt words: I ≈øay, <hi>Repent of your ≈øins.</hi> It may be God hath made me in≈øtrumental, to the plucking of ≈øome of you as Fire brands out of the fire, and in building of ≈øome of you up in the <hi>mo≈øt holy Faith:</hi> Remember what I ≈øay, I have cho≈øen this as my la≈øt words that ever I ≈øhal ≈øpeak to ≈øome of you.</p>
            <p>Object. But may ≈øome of you ≈øay, <hi>You bid me repent, how can I do it? I can no more repent than the dead man can ari≈øe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> It is true, O ≈øinner, that thou ≈øaye≈øt: But though thou can≈øt not repent when thou wilt, yet if thou wilt but endeavour to ≈øet thy ≈øelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the work, it is probable that God may give thee a repenting heart: therefore I ≈øay, take heed of ≈øhutting thy ≈øelf out from mercy.</p>
            <p>Object. But ≈øay you, <hi>Why do you then pre≈øs us to ≈øuch a work, when we cannot do it of our ≈øelves?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Mark here, when I ≈øay unto you, will you repent? That is, will you make u≈øe of the means that God hath appointed for your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance? Will you reckon up all the ≈øins you have committed again≈øt God? will you reckon up all the times that you have been drunk, or that
<pb facs="tcp:62760:291"/>you have ≈øworn an Oath? will you reckon up all the ≈øins that you ≈øtand guilty of between God and your own ≈øouls? and will you go to God and beg of him, that he would be plea≈øed to pardon them?</p>
            <p>But ≈øay you, <hi>What if we do not,?</hi> If you do not, then you are ≈øtill in your ≈øins, and there is no peace to you; there is no inward peace to your ≈øouls, there is no true peace to your Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But that I may prevail with you, I ≈øhall give you ≈øome grounds or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to pre≈øs this Argument more home upon your con≈øciences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt</hi> of all, Repent; becau≈øe Je≈øus Chri≈øt hath commanded you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great Penalties, if you do not.</p>
            <p>My beloved, con≈øider a little with your ≈øelves, who it is that ≈øpeaks unto you here in my Text.</p>
            <p>It is not I, but it is Je≈øus Chri≈øt; and doubtle≈øs Chri≈øt would never have per≈øwaded you to this work of repentance, if it were not nece≈ø≈øary.</p>
            <p>This book is the coun≈øel of the Phy≈øitian of your Souls, &amp; the Phy≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian of your Church, and the Phy≈øitian of your Kingdom. He that ≈øaith unto you, repent, ≈øaith, if you do not, <hi>Your ≈øins ≈øhall not be blotted out.</hi> He that ≈øaith unto you repent, ≈øaith, if you do not, <hi>Eternal death ≈øhal follow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Repent, I ≈øay, or if thou do≈øt not, wo be unto thee; wo unto that man that ever he was born; wo unto thee, it had been better thou had≈øt never ≈øeen the Light: Thy Parents that bore thee, they may repent that ever thou were born. Oh my beloved, it is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God! Oh my beloved, if your Parents ≈øhould ≈øee any of you carried in a Cart to the Gallows to be hanged, it would make them to repent that ever they brought you forth into the world! How much more then do you think it would trouble them for to ≈øee you thrown body and ≈øoul into Hell, there to be tormented with the Devil and his Angels for ever. I ≈øay, repent, or el≈øe God will take away the Go≈øpel from among you; repent, or God will take away his Mini≈øters from among you.</p>
            <p>The truth of it is, I have made it the greate≈øt part of my work, ever ≈øince I took the Office of a Mini≈øter upon me, for to get people upon their knees, &amp; when I could prevail ≈øo far with them, as to get them upon their knees, I thought with my ≈øelf, that then the work was half done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Repent;</hi> for Chri≈øt hath encouraged you with many precious promi≈øes, if you will repent.</p>
            <p>Object. But ≈øay you, <hi>This is a hard work: What! ≈øhall we ever go with tears in our eyes? what will God give us for our reward?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> My beloved, your Reward is great; would you know what
<pb facs="tcp:62760:291"/>you ≈øhall have? For your forrow, you ≈øhall have Crowns of Glory, you ≈øhall have Joy un≈øpeakable; if you will but repent of your ≈øins, God will blot them out. Me things it ≈øhould make thy heart for to ake, to think how God will deal with thee at the day of Judgment how God will ≈øay, before all the holy Angels, and before thou≈øands of righteous Per≈øons, <hi>Look what a hypocrite ≈øtands there.</hi> God will then make known the mo≈øt ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ≈øins, before men &amp; Angels, that thou would≈øt not have men to know now.</p>
            <p>Oh repent therefore, that your ≈øins may be blotted out, and you ≈øhall never hear more of your ≈øins; repent, and you ≈øhall be ≈øaved; repent, and you ≈øhall e≈øcape Hell.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, Repent,</hi> becau≈øe God hath waited a long while upon you, how long hath God ≈øtayed at your dores, asking you if you wou'd repent? how long, O thou proud man or woman, hath God waited upon thee? how often hath God come, and ≈øtood knocking at the dores of your hard hearts, you that are given to Taverns and Ale-hou≈øes, and rioting? how long will it be before I ≈øhall ≈øee you leave the≈øe Taverns and Ale-hou≈øes? and let me ≈øee you upon your knees in your Clo≈øets.</p>
            <p>Oh thou gray headed ≈øinner, God hath waited long upon thee, it may be ever ≈øince thou wert fifteen or ≈øixteen yeers old; as I have known many eminent Chri≈øtians at tho≈øe years, which hath made me much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire at it. Oh thou ≈øinner, God hath waited upon thee all this while, when wilt thou <hi>repent,</hi> Rom. 2.4. <hi>Or de≈øpi≈øe≈øt thou the Riches of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and forbearance and long ≈øuffering, not knowing that the goodne≈øs of God leadeth to Repentance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is not a ble≈ø≈øing thou ha≈øt from God, but it hath this written upon it, <hi>repent of thy ≈øins.</hi> Wilt thou think of what I ≈øay unto thee; when God puts thy bread into thy hands, he ≈øaith unto thee, <hi>Sinner, take this bread, eat it, and repent:</hi> when God puts the cup of Beer into thy hand, he ≈øaith unto thee, <hi>Sinner, take this beer, drink it, and repent;</hi> when thou ari≈øe≈øt in the morning, he ≈øaith unto thee, <hi>Sinner take this ≈øuit of cloaths, and put it on, and repent:</hi> Every mercy that thou receive≈øt from thy God, calls thee to come along with me; Come, wilt thou leave thy ≈øins and go along with me? wilt thou leave Hell, and go along with me? My beloved I will de≈øire you to bear a little with me, becau≈øe I am ≈øo urgent in pre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing this great work of Repentance: It is the la≈øt time that I ≈øhall ≈øpeak to ≈øome of you, and therefore I am ≈øomething the more earne≈øt with you: the Lord grant that they that ≈øhall come after me, may far exceed me in this work.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:292"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Con≈øider, if you will return and repent, God will return to you; if you will leave your ≈øins, God will not be angry with you; if you will have the means of grace, God will give you the means of grace. My beloved, God never goes from you<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> until you go away from him, God hath intreated you to return, and God hath promi≈øed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to you.</p>
            <p>My beloved, you have heard the Parable of the prodigal Son, how he ran away from his Father, but at la≈øt when he was ready to peri≈øh with hunger he returns to his Fathers hou≈øe again.</p>
            <p>So, my beloved, God is your Father, but you are Prodigals; all the ≈øins that you have committed again≈øt God is Prodigality. But yet, let me tell you, if you are willing to come to Gods feet, he will take you about the neck, if you are willing to for≈øake your ≈øins, God is willing and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to pardon your ≈øins; if you have been a wicked, ≈øinful, rebellious people, yet if you will turn to the Lord, he will turn to you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly, Repent;</hi> becau≈øe, if any mi≈øery doth come upon thee, the fault ≈øhal lye at thine own dore: I ≈øay, <hi>repent,</hi> for if God doth bring a Judgment upon thee, thou maye≈øt thank thy ≈øelf for it.</p>
            <p>Art thou a notorious ≈øinner, and God layes his afflicting hand upon thy Family, thy Family may thank thee for it, that the Lord is plea≈øed to deal by them as he doth. Many a Family may cur≈øe the Head of their Family, Oh thou drunken Ma≈øter, God doth ≈øend a Judgement upon thy Family, they may thank thee for it: and I tell thee, if any evil come upon the Church, it is thy fault; thanks be to you lyers, thanks be to you Swearers, thanks be to you Drunkards, that the Go≈øpel and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters are a going.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly, Repent;</hi> becau≈øe God ≈øendeth his Me≈ø≈øengers unto you for to intreat you to repent: I am ≈øent unto you this day, to intreat you to <hi>repent,</hi> now wo be to you if you neglect my me≈ø≈øage. You know that it was one rea≈øon why God took away his Prophets and Mini≈øters from <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> becau≈øe they would not hearken to their Me≈ø≈øage, as you may read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37, 38, 39. <hi>O Jeru≈øalem, Jeru≈øalem, thou that kille≈øt the Prophets, and ≈øtone≈øt them that are ≈øent unto thee; How often would I have gathered thy Children together, even as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings, and you would not? Behold your hou≈øe is left unto you de≈øolate: for I ≈øay unto you, ye ≈øhall not ≈øee me henceforth till ye ≈øhall ≈øay, Ble≈ø≈øed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know thee <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> thou hate≈øt and kille≈øt my Prophets that are ≈øent unto thee; when I come to thee again, thou ≈øhalt ≈øay, <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:292"/>Oh that you could apply this to your ≈øelves, Oh <hi>London! how often would I have gathered thee, as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings, but thou would≈øt not,</hi> But thou ha≈øt killed my Prophets, and ca≈øt them into pri≈øon Well, we are now taking leave of you this day; I, and my Mini≈øters are leaving of you, but when we come again unto you I will have you to be of another manner of temper then now you are.</p>
            <p>Well, if all that I have ≈øaid, will not prevail with you, I am ≈øorry that nothing would prevail with you but the flames of Hell. Oh then you will ≈øay, Oh that we had but hearkened to the voice of God's Me≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øengers that are ≈øent to us! Oh that we had our rou≈øing Mini≈øters to awaken us!</p>
            <p>I have one of Advice to you that are the people of God, who≈øe hearts God hath humbled, and I ≈øhall have done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> I advi≈øe you that God hath humbled for ≈øin, now to look to your ≈øelves, God will not now lead you, you mu≈øt learn now to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: If you would keep tender hearts, then be afraid of ≈øin: as well of the lea≈øt ≈øins, as of the greate≈øt: Be afraid of a vain thought; and if thou take≈øt heed of a vain thought, thou wilt be afraid of telling a lye; and if thou take≈øt heed of telling a lye, thou wilt be afraid of ≈øwearing an Oath.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If thou wilt keep tenderne≈øs of heart, then lye under the be≈øt Mini≈øtry you can get; that there is a difference between ≈øome mens. Preaching and others, is plain by the effectual working of their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the hearts of their hearers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> Take heed of a blind ignorant Mini≈øter; <hi>If the blind lead the blind they will both fall into the ditch.</hi> If one that under≈øtands not what ≈øin is, nor feels not the guilt of ≈øin, Preaches <hi>Repentance,</hi> it is ten hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to one, if ever God doth work upon your hearts by his Preaching.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Take heed of, fly, ≈øhun, avoid an idle drunken Mini≈øter, If you would ask me, what we ≈øhall do in ≈øuch a ca≈øe?</p>
            <p>I <hi>An≈øwer,</hi> Keep ≈øuch a one out of your Pari≈øh, if you can; if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, then I advi≈øe you to take heed how you hear him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> Becau≈øe all ≈øuch Mini≈øters, are no Mini≈øters at all. No, what and are ordained? No, becau≈øe they are not ≈øent from God. And let me tell you, that men have no power to Ordain ≈øuch to Preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpal, as are not ≈øent by God. I do verily believe that God never ≈øent any Mini≈øter for to Preach the Doctrine of Salvation, but ≈øuch as God hath endowed with gifts and abilities to ≈øpeak; and if there be any <hi>Mini≈øters</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:293"/>that have not tho≈øe qualifications that are fit for a Bi≈øhop to have, then they are none of Gods Mini≈øters, although they are made Mini≈øters by man, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>This is a true ≈øaying, If a man de≈øire the Office of a Bi≈øhop, he de≈øireth a good work. A Bi≈øhop then mu≈øt be blamele≈øs, the husband of one wife; vigilant, ≈øober, of good behaviour, given to ho≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, apt to teach, not given to wine, no ≈øtriker, not greedy of filthy lucre, but patient; not a brawler, not covetous: own that ruleth well his own hou≈øe having his children in ≈øubjection with all gravity. For if a man know not how to rule his own hou≈øe, how ≈øhall he take care of the Church of God? Not a Novice, le≈øt being lifted up with Pride, he fall into the condemnation of the Devil. Moreover he mu≈øt have a good report of them which are without, le≈øt he fall into reproach, and the ≈ønare of the Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is all the≈øe excellent qualifications that a Mini≈øter of the Go≈øpel ought to be endowed with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ≈øay that tho≈øe Mini≈øters that are not endowed with the≈øe qualifications but are ignorant drunken Mini≈øters, it is generally ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that people grow more wicked, and that their hearts grow harder, while they live under ≈øuch a Mini≈øtry.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But how if we are forced to hear ≈øuch, and we can do no others wi≈øe; if we will not hear them our pur≈øes mu≈øt pay for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øwer.</hi> To this I an≈øwer, I wi≈øh that every place had an eminent Mini≈øter, that you might gather up Manna at your own dores; But if your Mini≈øter be wicked and prophane, he is no Mini≈øter of Chri≈øt, and in ≈øuch a ca≈øe, you mu≈øt rather hazard your pur≈øes than you ≈øouls.</p>
            <p>But the Doctrin that he preaches it is good: 'Tis true, it is ≈øo, if it do not come out of a ≈øtinking ve≈ø≈øel. The water that is drawn out of a ≈øweet Well, if it be put into a ≈øtinking cask, it will ≈ømell of the cask. But I would not have you to be quarrel≈øome.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Third</hi> advice that I ≈øhall give you is this, Be ≈øure that you ply the company of tho≈øe that are of a tender heart: It is a true ≈øaying, <hi>Birds of a feather will flock together.</hi> Take heed of being in the company of ≈øuch as will ≈øwear, and of living with ≈øuch as ≈øcoff at religion. It's true, a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>holy heart</hi> may live <hi>among</hi> wicked <hi>company,</hi> as <hi>Lot</hi> did in <hi>Sodom;</hi> but let me tell thee, there's danger, they'l tempt thee to be like them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>La≈øtly,</hi> My advice is this, Be ≈øure that the Bible be much in your hand, you that can read, and beg of God to give you an under≈øtanding heart. When God bids you to be holy, think of Heaven. Let the Bible be much in your hands, and let God ≈øee you much in your Clo≈øets.</p>

            </p>
            <p>My main and principal de≈øigne at this time is, to ≈øhew unto you ≈øome <hi>few</hi> of tho≈øe <hi>many</hi> grand Errors that are in <hi>popery,</hi> or in the <hi>popi≈øh Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and likewi≈øe to fortifie you again≈øt them.</p>
            <p>Among many others, there are the≈øe thirteen grand Errors in <hi>popery,</hi> that every good Chri≈øtian mu≈øt <hi>take off, and flee from.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fir≈øt Error is this, The papi≈øts do hold, <hi>That the Pope is the Head of the Church:</hi> This is diametrically, and point-blank oppo≈øite to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Col. 2.9. Chri≈øt is there called. <hi>The Head of the Church.</hi> Now to make the Pope the Head of the Church is to make the Church <hi>mon≈øtrous</hi> by having two Heads. This is to make <hi>the Spou≈øe of Chri≈øt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That is the fir≈øt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62760:299"/>A ≈øecond Error, which I ≈øhall but name, is this, The Papi≈øts hold, <hi>That the Pope is above Scripture,</hi> and that his <hi>Laws, Decrees</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> bind more than the Scriptures, than the Word of God. Well may he have that name written upon his Miter, that's mentioned, Rev. 13, 1. <hi>And upon his head was written the Names of bla≈øphemy.</hi> But I add,</p>
            <p>Their third Error, is the <hi>Ma≈øs,</hi> which indeed is gro≈øs <hi>Idolatry;</hi> there is in it the≈øe two Errors.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Tran≈øub≈øtantiation. Bellarmine,</hi> with other Popi≈øh Writers, ≈øay, that the <hi>Bread</hi> the <hi>Ho≈øt</hi> after con≈øecration, is turned into the very body of Chri≈øt. Now this is again≈øt <hi>Philo≈øophy,</hi> as well as <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Divinitie.</hi> 'Tis again≈øt <hi>Philo≈øophy,</hi> for this is clear, if Chri≈øts Body be in <hi>Heaven,</hi> then it cannot po≈ø≈øibly be in the <hi>bread:</hi> But Chri≈øts Body is in <hi>Heaven,</hi> Act. 3 22. <hi>Whom the Heavens mu≈øt contain</hi> ≈øpeaking of Chri≈øt) <hi>until the re≈øtitution of all things,</hi> Moreover, that the bread in the Sacrament is not turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Body of Chri≈øt, I prove thus; the wicked they do not receive Chri≈øt, 1 Cor. 2.14. But if the bread be the very body of Chri≈øt, then the wicked, when they eat of the bread do eat the very body of Chri≈øt. This is ≈øo gro≈øs an Opinion, that mo≈øt of the antient Fathers wrote again≈øt it, as <hi>Cyprian, Origen, Tertullian, Au≈øtin, Ambro≈øe,</hi> with many others.</p>
            <p>But 2ly. The ≈øecond Error in the <hi>Ma≈øs</hi> is, they <hi>do daily offer</hi> up <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> in the <hi>Ma≈øs.</hi> I grant there are <hi>Prie≈øts</hi> in Go≈øpel times, and <hi>Sacrifices</hi> too, but they are as ≈øuch are <hi>≈øpiritual;</hi> as the ≈øacifice of <hi>Prayer</hi> of <hi>Prai≈øe,</hi> of a <hi>broken and contrite heart.</hi> But that there ≈øhould be any external offering of Chri≈øt by way of Sacrifice, is a <hi>bla≈øphemy</hi> again≈øt Chri≈øts <hi>Prie≈øtly Office;</hi> for it ≈øuppo≈øeth, that Chri≈øts Offering on the Cro≈øs was not perfect. That is notoriou≈øly contrary to the very letter of Scripture. See Heb. 10.12. <hi>That man.</hi> i. e. Chri≈øt, God-man, <hi>after he had once offered a Sacrifice for ≈øin, ≈øat down at the right hand of God:</hi> and ver≈ø. 14. he ≈øaith, <hi>That by this one offering he hath</hi> perfected <hi>for ever them that are ≈øanctified.</hi> This Scripture ≈øheweth the compleatne≈øs of Chri≈øts Sufferings and Sacrifice, and that now there needs no offring up any more Sacrifices. That is the third: But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> A fourth Error is: the Doctrine of Popi≈øh <hi>Satisfaction;</hi> they hold that we do, in our <hi>own per≈øons,</hi> ≈øatisfie Gods ju≈øtice by our <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, VVhippig, Fa≈øting, Alms-deeds.</hi> Thus the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the Popi≈øh <hi>Rhemes.</hi> But where is any thing of this in Scripture? alas, what is our confe≈ø≈øion of ≈øin, that is no ≈øatisfaction for ≈øin: If a <hi>Traytor</hi> confe≈øs his guilt, this is no ≈øatisfaction for, but rather an agra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb facs="tcp:62760:299"/>of his Trea≈øon. Alas, our <hi>Repentance, Fa≈øting, Humiliation,</hi> the be≈øt of our actions are <hi>be-leopard,</hi> and mixt with very much ≈øin; our <hi>Humiliation</hi> is mixt with very much pride, our <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øion,</hi> with much <hi>Hyporri≈øie</hi> and <hi>Di≈ø≈øimulation.</hi> Ther's much of ≈øin in the cream of our ≈øervices, and ≈øin cannot ≈øatisfie for ≈øin. This is a ≈øure rule (and I pray you mark it) that what ever offering we bring to God for acceptation, we mu≈øt lay it upon the Altar Je≈øus Chri≈øt, for Gods Ju≈øtice accepts of no ≈øatisfaction, but by and through the Lord Je≈øus. And that's a fourth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fiftly,</hi> A fifth Error is, There is di≈øtingui≈øhing between ≈øins <hi>Mortal</hi> and ≈øins <hi>Venial:</hi> Mortal ≈øins are <hi>Murder, Perjury, Adultery,</hi> and ≈øuch like; the≈øe (≈øay they) de≈øerve <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Damnation;</hi> but Venial ≈øins, ≈øuch as <hi>vain thoughts, ra≈øh anger, concupe≈øence,</hi> the≈øe (≈øay they) do not de≈øerve Death.</p>
            <p>But we ≈øay and affirm, That there is no ≈øuch ≈øins as they call <hi>Venial.</hi> It is true, the greate≈øt ≈øins being repented of, are pardonable through the blood of Chri≈øt; but there is no ≈øin of which we can ≈øay, that do not de≈øerve death and damnation. And this I'le prove by a double Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. If the very lea≈øt ≈øin be (as indeed it is) a breach and violation of Gods Law, then 'tis no more <hi>venial</hi> than a <hi>greater:</hi> But the lea≈øt ≈øin is a violation of Gods Law; therefore the lea≈øt ≈øin is no more <hi>venial</hi> than a greater. The <hi>minor</hi> is clearly proved from <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.28. <hi>Who≈øoever looks on a Woman to lu≈øt after her, hath committed Adultery with her in his heart:</hi> In which place our Saviour makes a <hi>la≈øcivious look,</hi> an impure glance of the eye, to be a breach and violation of Gods Law.</item>
               <item>2. If the lea≈øt ≈øin expo≈øe men to a Cur≈øe, then they are no more <hi>veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> than <hi>greater;</hi> but the lea≈øt ≈øin doth expo≈øe men to a <hi>Cur≈øe,</hi> Gal. 3.10. <hi>Cur≈øed is he that continues not in all things contained in the Law, to do them.</hi> He that faileth in the lea≈øt <hi>iota</hi> or <hi>punctillio,</hi> it expo≈øeth him unto a <hi>Cur≈øe.</hi> And remember this (my brethren) <hi>That without repentance, God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a great Hell for little ≈øins.</hi> That is the fifth.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> A ≈øixth Error in Popery is, Their a≈ø≈øerting the <hi>Doctrine of free-will.</hi> That <hi>Goliah</hi> of the Papi≈øts, <hi>Beliarmine,</hi> ≈øaith, That mans will is inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto good, and that a man hath an <hi>inate</hi> power to do that which is good; but mans will being corrupted and depraved, is not inclinable to that which is good, but quite contrary. And this is evident from our own experience, had we no Bible to confirm it.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Rudder</hi> of a Ship is broke, the Ship is carried up and
<pb facs="tcp:62760:300"/>down, to and again, which way the wind will: even ≈øo it is with mans will being corrupted. <hi>Austin,</hi> in his Confe≈ø≈øions, ≈øaith, That before his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>onver≈øion he did accu≈øtome him≈øelf to fruit ≈øtealing, not ≈øo much out of a love to the fruit, as to ≈øtealing. Hence is it that men are ≈øaid to love evil, <hi>Mica</hi> 3.2.</p>
            <p>Again, the will being depraved and corrupt, hath no <hi>inate</hi> power to do that which is good Indeed the Papi≈øts ≈øay, That man hath ≈øome ≈øeed of good in him; but the Scripture doth not ≈øay ≈øo. Man as St. <hi>Ambro≈øe</hi> well ≈øaith, hath a free will to ≈øin, but how to perform that which is good he finds not.</p>
            <p>Sin hath cut the locks where our ≈øtrength lay. Therefore are we ≈øaid to be without ≈øtrength. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. Sinners are ≈øaid to be in the <hi>bond of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> and ≈øo not in a <hi>po≈øture</hi> to run heavens Race. A man by nature cannot do that that he hath the <hi>lea≈øt bent,</hi> and <hi>tendency</hi> to that which is <hi>good:</hi> he is ≈øo far from performing a good act, as that he cannot ≈øo much as think a good thought. Hence it is that man is ≈øaid to have a heart of ≈øtone: he can no more prepare him≈øelf for his <hi>Conver≈øion,</hi> than a ≈øtone can prepare it ≈øelf for the <hi>Super≈øtruction:</hi> Men <hi>naturally,</hi> are dead <hi>≈øpiritually.</hi> In mans will there is not only <hi>impotency,</hi> but <hi>ob≈øtinacy.</hi> Hence it is men are ≈øaid to re≈øi≈øt <hi>the holy Gho≈øt,</hi> Act 7. But I go on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly.</hi> A ≈øeventh Error is, their <hi>Indulgencies.</hi> They ≈øay, the <hi>Pope</hi> hath a power to give a pardon and <hi>Indulgence,</hi> by vertue of which men are freed from their ≈øins in Gods ≈øight.</p>
            <p>Be≈øides the Bla≈øphemy of this a≈ø≈øertion, what el≈øe is it but a cunning trick and ≈øly artifice to get money by. This is that indeed brings <hi>gri≈øts</hi> to the Popes <hi>Mill.</hi> How contrary is this to the Scripture, which ≈øaith, <hi>None can forgive ≈øin but God only?</hi> Mark 2.</p>
            <p>This Doctrin of <hi>Popi≈øh Indulgence,</hi> is a key that unlocks and opens a door to all manner of <hi>licentiou≈øne≈øs</hi> and <hi>uncleane≈øs:</hi> for what need per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons care what they do, if they (for their money) can obtain a pardon? Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in his Book of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> mentions one that at fir≈øt was a <hi>papi≈øt,</hi> and being brought before <hi>Bonner,</hi> ≈øaid, Sir, at the fir≈øt I was of your <hi>Religion,</hi> and then I cared not how I lived, becau≈øe I could with my mony obtain a pardon.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eightly,</hi> An eight Error is <hi>The Doctrine of Merits:</hi> they ≈øay that <hi>good works</hi> do <hi>expiate</hi> ≈øin and merit glory. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ≈øaith, a man hath a double right to glory; one by Chri≈øts merits, and the other by his own, And for this he urges, 2 <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Henceforth is laid up
<pb facs="tcp:62760:300"/>for me a crown of Righteou≈øne≈øs, which the ju≈øt Judge ≈øhall give unto me, and not only unto me, &amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>Ninthly,</hi> The ninth Error in the Popi≈øh Religion is, the Doctrine of <hi>Purgatory.</hi> There is, ≈øay they, a <hi>middle</hi> and <hi>infirnal</hi> place, called <hi>Purgatory.</hi> Now what is this but a ≈øubtile <hi>artifice</hi> and trick to get money? for when they (e≈øpecially tho≈øe that are rich) are about to <hi>die</hi> and make <hi>Wills,</hi> if ≈øo be they will give large ≈øums of money, the Prie≈øts will pray for them that they go not into <hi>Purgatory;</hi> or if they <hi>do,</hi> that they may be quickly delivered out of it. How contrary and repugnant is this to Scripture, that holds forth no <hi>Middlle place?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The wicked when they die, their <hi>Souls</hi> go immediately to Hell, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.23. <hi>The rich man was buried, and in hell he lift up his eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tis true there is a <hi>Purgatory</hi> in this life, and that is the <hi>Blood of Chri≈øt</hi> 1 Joh. 1.17. <hi>If we are not purged by this blood, while we live, we ≈øhall never be purged after by fire.</hi> Wicked men, when they dye, do not go into a fire of <hi>purgation</hi> but <hi>damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, on the other hand, <hi>Believers</hi> when they die pa≈øs immediately to Heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.43. <hi>This day ≈øhalt thou be with me in Paradi≈øe, Chri≈øt Je≈øus</hi> was now on the <hi>Cro≈øs,</hi> and was <hi>in≈øtantly</hi> to be in Heaven; and the <hi>penitent Theif</hi> was immediately to be with <hi>Chri≈øt:</hi> Here is no mention of any ≈øuch place as <hi>Purgatory.</hi> The antient and <hi>Orthodox</hi> Fathers were all again≈øt <hi>Purgatory;</hi> as <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtome, Cyprian. Au≈øtine, Fulgentius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tenthly,</hi> A tenth Error is, the <hi>Invocation</hi> of Angels, a praying unto them. This is a certain rule, that <hi>Angel-wor≈øhip</hi> is <hi>VVill-wor≈øhip,</hi> expre≈øly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in Scripture, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>di≈øtinction</hi> of <hi>Mediators,</hi> of <hi>Redemption,</hi> and of <hi>Interce≈ø≈øion,</hi> doth not help them; Though we pray (≈øay they) to Angels as <hi>Mediators</hi> of <hi>Interce≈ø≈øion,</hi> yet we pray to Chri≈øt as <hi>Mediator</hi> of <hi>Redemption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Je≈øus Chri≈øt in Scripture is not only called a <hi>Redeemer,</hi> but al≈øo an <hi>Advocate:</hi> and it is a ≈øin to make any our <hi>Interce≈ø≈øor</hi> but <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt.</hi> That it is ≈øinful to pray to Angels, is clear from many Scriptures: See <hi>Rom</hi> 5.10. <hi>How ≈øhall they call on him, in whom they have not believed?</hi> Mark, we may not pray to any but them in whom we believe: But we cannot believe an <hi>Angel,</hi> therefore we mu≈øt not pray to an <hi>Angel.</hi> So al≈øo in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Having therefore boldne≈øs to enter into the holie≈øt by the Blood of Ie≈øus;</hi> He only is to be prayed unto, by whom we have entrance into the <hi>Holie≈øt:</hi> but it is by <hi>Ie≈øus Chri≈øt</hi> that we enter into the holie≈øt; therefore it is only <hi>Ie≈øus Chri≈øt</hi> that we mu≈øt pray unto. That is the tenth.</p>
            <p n="11">11ly. An eleventh Error is, Their <hi>VVor≈øhipping of Images;</hi> they burn
<pb facs="tcp:62760:301"/>
               <hi>Inccen≈øe</hi> before the Image, which is a Divine wor≈øhip unto the Image.

            <p n="12">12ly. Another Error in the Popi≈øh Religion is, <hi>They deny Je≈øus Chri≈øt ≈øuffered the pains of Hell in his Soul.</hi> Indeed, to give them their due, they do aggravate the pains of Chri≈øts <hi>Body,</hi> but they deny he felt the Pains and Torments of Hell in his <hi>Soul.</hi> This Opinion doth much le≈ø≈øen the Sufferings of Chri≈øt <hi>for us,</hi> the ≈øame doth <hi>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But when we ≈øay, Chri≈øt ≈øuffered the Pains of Hell in his Soul, we do not mean that he felt <hi>horror of con≈øcience,</hi> as the damned do; but we mean he felt that that was <hi>equivolent</hi> to it, he felt the <hi>burden</hi> and <hi>pain</hi> of Gods wrath.

Can we think we ≈øhall be at ea≈øe till we come to God? Is it like to be well with us while our wayes are contrary to the wayes of God? are not thy waies the waies of peace? Oh! how can we be at re≈øt when our waies are contrary to thine? Oh! un-lu≈øt us; we had better part from our idols here, that that they ≈øhould part us from God hereafter. Lord, if there were no other hell, this is damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be a ≈øinne, for this is the nature of ≈øin to ≈øeparate us from God. Oh help us to account the reproaches of Chri≈øt, better than the honors of the Cro≈øs of Chri≈øt, better than the Crown of the world. O ≈øhew us the ≈øinfulne≈øs of ≈øin, and the emptine≈øs of the world, that we may take thy Coun≈øel and mind thy Glory, and be ruled by thy Will: Oh how happy would it be with us if our ≈øouls were brought into ≈øuch a <hi>frame!</hi> We are, Lord, as yet great ≈øtrangers to the life of God; Oh! let us know what it is to live with thee, and to thee, and with thee, that we may ≈øay, <hi>For us to live in Chri≈øt, and to die is gain;</hi> and that we may ≈øay, <hi>Whom have

And ≈øeeing thou art plea≈øed to make u≈øe of ≈øuch a poor thing as the preaching of the Go≈øpel is, and ≈øeeing this is the means to bring our ≈øouls to eternal life, Oh let it be ≈øo to us, that we may repent from ≈øin, and believe in the righteou≈øne≈øs of the Go≈øpel: Oh Lord, thou knowe≈øt all our frailties, and all our nece≈ø≈øities: find out them that are dead in ≈øins, and quicken them; find out the hard hearts, and ≈øoften them; find out the proud hearts, and humble them; find out the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mali≈øts, and bring them to the power of godline≈øs and pour in wine and oyl into the wounds of the wounded in ≈øpirit; and let the admini≈øtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Go≈øpel, be in the demon≈øtration of the Spirit, that as the truth is delivered to us, we may be delivered to the truth, that while we touch the hem of thy garment, Vertue may come out from thee.

            <p>NOt knowing whether ever I ≈øhal ≈øpeak to you more from this place, being willing to leave a word in ≈øea≈øon, I ≈øhall recommend to you what in an≈øwer to prayer I have recived of the Lord for the directing me in my cour≈øe in this gloomy dark day; being well a≈ø≈øured that as many of us as work by this rule, and fall by this compa≈øs (how ever we may be ≈øcatered by the tewpe≈øtuous ≈øtorms we meet with here in the Sea of this World) ≈øhall ≈øhortly arrive at, and meet in our de≈øired Port, the Haven of Eternal Re≈øt and Happine≈øs; What therefore the Lord hath ≈øaid to me, and that with a ≈øtrong hand, that ≈øay I unto you in the Name of the Lord; <hi>Wait on the Lord, and keep his VVay.</hi>

               <item>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That they ≈øo carry them≈øelves towards the Lord in keeping on in their way of following him, as becomes tho≈øe that firmly believe and ≈øteadfa≈øtly hope in him for his Salvation, There are many particular directions to this purpo≈øe, <hi>ver≈ø.</hi> 3. <hi>Tru≈øt in the Lord, and do good, ver≈ø.</hi> 4. <hi>Delight thy ≈øelf al≈øo in the Lord, ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thy way unto the Lord, ver.</hi> 7. <hi>Re≈øt in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him. ver.</hi> 27. <hi>Depart from evil, and do good;</hi> and here in that text, <hi>Wait on the Lord, and keep his way.</hi>

            </list>
            <p>The≈øe words contain Advice and Coun≈øel for the People of God, and it is con≈øiderable, either with re≈øpect to the troubles and temptations of the people of God in general; or with re≈øpect to that particular that is immediately touched on before the text, <hi>ver.</hi> 33. <hi>The wicked watcheth the righteous, and ≈øeeketh to ≈ølay him.</hi> Upon this ≈øomething is ≈øpoken by way of encouragement to the Righteous, <hi>ver.</hi> 33. <hi>The Lord will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.</hi> Though he may let him fall into the hands of the Wicked, he will not leave him there; though the Wicked may ≈øit in Judgement on him, and pa≈øs ≈øentence again≈øt him, yet the Lord will not condemn him; yea, when he is judged he is cha≈øten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Lord, that he ≈øhould not be condemned with the World. Thus for the encourgement of the Righteous.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is ≈øomething by way of direction in the words read: <hi>VVait on the Lord, and keep his Way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the words, con≈øider under this double reference, we have this profitable point of Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>However it go with the truly Godly in this world, more e≈øpecially when the Wicked watch the Righteous to do them a mi≈øchief, it is their be≈øt way to wait on the Lord, and keep his way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ≈øhall not ≈øpend time to ≈øhew you who are truly Godly, and who are Wicked. It is ≈øaid of the Godly man, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. <hi>the Law of God is in his heart,</hi> Such then as from the Law of God in their hearts have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect to all his Commandments, walking in all the Statutes, and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God blamele≈øs. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.6. ≈øuch are truly Godly: And ≈øuch as from the dominion of ≈øin in them, are evill Doers, workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:315"/>walking according to the Lu≈øts of the fle≈øh; and of the mind, according to the cour≈øe of this world, of the Prince of the Power of the Air, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are wicked.</p>
            <p>In the handling of this point, according to my wonted method, I ≈øhall ≈øpeak fir≈øt to what is ≈øuppo≈øed, and then to what is expre≈øly laid down.</p>
            <p>Here are two things ≈øuppo≈øed in this point: the one more Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, the other more Particular.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt, In General;</hi> 'Tis ≈øuppo≈øed, that the condition of the truly god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, may be full of troubles, afflictions and di≈øtre≈ø≈øes in this world, for when 'tis ≈øaid, <hi>However it may go with the truly godly,</hi> the meaning is, how evilly, how badly ≈øoever, though they be never ≈øo much troubled, afflicted and di≈øtre≈ø≈øed; wherein it is ≈øuppo≈øed that it may go very ill that the truly godly may be full of troubles, ≈øufferings and di≈øtre≈ø≈øes: this not only plainly held forth in Scripture, in ≈øuch texts as the≈øe, <hi>P≈øa.</hi> 34.19. <hi>John</hi> 16.33. <hi>Acts</hi> 14.22. but ≈øo ≈øadly experienced in all ages, that we need not ≈øpend time in the clearing of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, More particularly;</hi> It is ≈øuppo≈øed, <hi>That is the manner and gui≈øe of the wicked to watch the Righteous to mi≈øchief them:</hi> ≈øo ver≈øe. 32. and ver≈øe 12. <hi>The wicked plotteth again≈øt the ju≈øt;</hi> (or as the margent <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti≈øeth</hi>) <hi>i. e.</hi> his wit and skill, his labour and judgment is employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt him: and <hi>ver≈ø.</hi> 14. <hi>The wicked have drawn their ≈øword, and bent their how to ca≈øt down the poor and needy, and to ≈ølay ≈øuch as be of upright conver≈øation.</hi> ≈øo <hi>p≈øal.</hi> 64.2. the P≈øalmi≈øt prays, <hi>Hide me from the ≈øecret coun≈øel of the wicked, from the in≈øurrection of the workers of iniquity, who whet their tongues like a ≈øword, and bend their bows to ≈øhoot their arrows, even bitter words, that they may ≈øhoot at ≈øecret in the perfect: ≈øuddenly do they ≈øhoot at him, and fear not.</hi> ≈øo we read in that <hi>I≈øai.</hi> 29.20.21. of tho≈øe <hi>that watch for iniquity that make a man an offender for a word that lay a ≈ønare for him that reproveth in the gate and that turn a≈øide the ju≈øt for a thing of naught.</hi> Thus it hath been over ≈øince the beginning. So wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Cain</hi> watched righteous <hi>Abel</hi> to kill him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.8. <hi>and Cain talked with Abel his brother; and it came to pa≈øs that when they were in the field, that Cain ro≈øe up again≈øt his brother Abel, and ≈ølew him.</hi> And thus have <hi>Cain's</hi> brood done all down along (for he was of the wicked one; 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.12.) ≈øo hath <hi>E≈ødu</hi> watched righteous <hi>Jacob</hi> Gen. 27 41.42. comforting him≈øelf, that he ≈øhould ≈øhortly have a time to do him the mi≈øchief that he intended him ≈øo <hi>Saul</hi> watcheth righteous <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 19.11. <hi>Saul ≈øent me≈ø≈øengers to David hou≈øe, to watch him and ≈øtay him in the morning:</hi> And ≈øo did others, his wicked adver≈øaries, watch him, as you have him complaining, <hi>p≈øal.</hi> 38.12. <hi>They that ≈øeek after
<pb facs="tcp:62760:316"/>my life, lay ≈ønares for me; and they that ≈øeek my hurt, ≈øpeak mi≈øchievous things, and imagine deceit all the day long.</hi> And P≈øal. 140.5. <hi>The proud have laid a ≈ønare for me, and cords; they have ≈øpread a net by the way ≈øide; they have ≈øet gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>s for me.</hi> So did <hi>Jeremiah's</hi> Familiars, as he calls them, Jer. 20.10. <hi>For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every ≈øide: Report ≈øay they, and we will report it: all my familliars</hi> (or as in the Margent, every man of my peace) <hi>watched for my haltings; ≈øaying, peradventure he will be enticed, and we ≈øhall prevail again≈øt him, and we ≈øhall take our revenge of him.</hi> While they pretended friend≈øhip and peace, they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nothing but mi≈øchief, even the taking of their revenge on him. So the Pre≈øidents and the Princes, watched righteous <hi>Daniel</hi> to mi≈øchief him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.4. where fir≈øt they ≈øeek to find occa≈øion again≈øt him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> they would gladly have found any occa≈øion again≈øt him, to have accu≈øed him of Di≈øloyalty; Sedition, Trea≈øon, Rebellion, or at lea≈øt fal≈øhood and unfaithfulne≈øs; but here they could find no fault, his very enemies being Judges, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. In the next place, therefore they plot, to find occa≈øion again≈øt him from the Law of his God; and therefore enticing the King to make a Law again≈øt the Law of <hi>Daniels</hi> God, they quickly catch him. So you may ≈øee the <hi>Scribes and Phari≈øees</hi> watched the Lord Je≈øus, that <hi>Ju≈øt One</hi> Luke 67. <hi>And the Scribes and Phari≈øees watched him, whether he would heal on the Sabbath day, that they might find an accu≈øation again≈øt him.</hi> It ≈øeems they had a Law again≈øt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good on the Sabbath day. So, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.19, 20. <hi>And the chief Prie≈øt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>es and the Scribes, ≈øought to lay hands on him, and they feared the people; for they perceived that he had ≈øpoke this parable again≈øt them, and they watched him, and ≈øent forth ≈øpies, which ≈øhould fain them≈øelves ju≈øt men, that they might take hold of his words, that ≈øo they might deliver him to the power and authority of the governour.</hi> They endeavour to trapan him, that they might give him over to the ≈øecular Power. Time would fail to ≈øhow how they watched the Apo≈øtles, and the Saints, all down along throughout all Ages: Neither need we ≈øearch the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of former ages, in this matter, for evidence, our own times af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording pregnant proof, more then enough in this thing; and as it hath been, and now is, ≈øo it will be to the end of this wicked world, the gui≈øe and manner of the Wicked, thus to watch the Righteous to do him a mi≈øchief.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For that there is the ≈øame principle of hatred and enmity in the Wicked again≈øt the Rigeteous now, as ever, yea, and ever will to the worlds end. That enmity that we read of in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. is a la≈øting en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, as long as there is any of the ≈øeed of the Serpent in the world,
<pb facs="tcp:62760:316"/>it will work; it is an enmity in nature, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.27. <hi>He that is upright in the way is an abomination to the wicked;</hi> and the wicked mu≈øt cea≈øe to be wicked, ere this will cea≈øe to be: As there are ≈øome Creatures that have an enmity in nature, as the Woolf and the Sheep, ≈øo that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is propagated to all of the kind that partake of that nature: So is the enmity that the children of the wicked one have again≈øt the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God: As therefore the Wolf need not be taught to watch to devour the Sheep, it being natural to him; ≈øo the wicked need not be taught to do the Saints a mi≈øchief, having a principle within them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining, and in≈øtructing them thereunto.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is the ≈øame nece≈ø≈øary ground and occa≈øion of their hatred of them: though there be no ju≈øt ground of the wicked hatred of the righteous, (hence <hi>David</hi> ≈øpeaks of their hating him without a cau≈øe, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 69 4. that is, without ju≈øt cau≈øe on his part) yet there is a nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary ground of their hatred, and that continueth now as heretofore, and will continue as long as there are any truly <hi>godly,</hi> and what that is, you may ≈øee in that. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 38.20. <hi>They al≈øo that render evil for good, are mine adver≈øaries; becau≈øe I follow the thing that good is.</hi> The true ground and rea≈øon of their being adver≈øaries unto <hi>David,</hi> was this, Becau≈øe he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that which they hated.</p>
            <p>Thus our Saviour ≈øhewing his Di≈øciples how they ≈øhould be hated of the world, acquaints them with the true cau≈øe and ground of the worlds hatred, <hi>John</hi> 15 19. <hi>If you were of the world; the world would love his own; but becau≈øe you are not of the world, but I have cho≈øen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</hi> And that this is the proper ground of the worlds hatred, is mo≈øt manife≈øt, for that the ≈øame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, whom the world loved while he was of the world, when called out of the world into the Kingdome of Chri≈øt, then is he hated of tho≈øe that before loved him; as in <hi>Paul.</hi> And if a per≈øon that profe≈ø≈øeth him≈øelf the Di≈øciple of Chri≈øt, and is hated of the world, ≈øhall for≈øake the a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembly of the Saints, and turn back from the way of righteou≈øne≈øs, and run into the ≈øame exce≈øs of riot with the prophane world, none more the worlds darling then he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>. So that it is Godline≈øs, Holine≈øs, and true Religion, that is the true ground of the worlds hatred. So 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Not as Cain who was of the wicked one, and ≈ølew his brother; and wherefore ≈ølew he him? becau≈øe his own works were evil, and his brothers righteous.</hi> This was the true cau≈øe of his hatred; and while that the cau≈øe remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, while godly men continue to walk in the ways of godline≈øs, the wicked will continue to hate them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Devil, who≈øe Children the≈øe wicked ones are, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8.
<pb facs="tcp:62760:317"/>10. is ≈øtill as malitious and indu≈øtrious as ever, to put them upon this. We read of Satan in that, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. that he goeth up and down like a roaring Lyon, ≈øeeking whom he may devour; and as far as the Lord permits him, he acts wicked men in whom he ruleth, <hi>Ephe≈ø.</hi> 2.2 to do what mi≈øchief they can to the Godly; yea, and in the la≈øt times he is ≈øo far from abating his rage, as that we read, <hi>his wrath groweth the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becau≈øe he knoweth he hath but a ≈øhort time,</hi> Rev. 12.12.</p>
            <p>While therefore the principle of enmity, which is in the wicked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the Saints, remaineth, and while the ground of their hatred con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>

            </p>
            <p>Now if it be thus taken here, Then to keep his VVay is diligently to attend his Hand, and to ob≈øerve his Carriage, and ordering, in all that befals his People, more e≈øpecially in all that trouble that comes on them: For whatever trouble comes upon the People of God and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the in≈øtruments of inflicting, the Lord hath his way in it, <hi>Mit.</hi> 6.9. ordering it, as to the kind, as to the mea≈øure, as to the ≈øea≈øon, as to the continuance, and as to the ends and fruits.</p>
            <p>Now, to ob≈øerve the Lord's Hand, and to attend his VVay, in order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Providences, and our troubles; this is to keep his VVay.

            <p n="4">4.

In that <hi>John.</hi> 5.44. our Saviour di≈øtingui≈øheth between that honour that is of men, and that Honour that is of God; and that is the <hi>the true Honour</hi> that is of God: For as they ≈øay, <hi>Honor e≈øt in honorante, non in honorate,</hi> in him that honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and then that is true and highe≈øt honor that is from the only true God, that high and only One.

There is no entring into the way of the Lord, but by the Spirit, Joh. 3, 3. we all naturally being gon a≈øtray, wander from the way of the Lord, and it is the ≈øpirit only that can, and doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce men into this way; and the be≈øt being but lame, and having not only a principle of halting in, but declining from it, there is no walking in this Way, but by the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance and guidance of the Spirit. Let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Spirit of God be your guide; it is compri≈øed, that he ≈øhall <hi>lead you into all truth,</hi> John 16.13.

Here you have the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing his Way, and that clearly and plainly, ≈øo that the mo≈øt ≈øimple, that apply them≈øelves to it, may under≈øtand it: the Scriptures are a perfect and a con≈øtant rule: Therefore, as in that, I≈øa. 8.26. <hi>To the Law and to the Te≈øtimony; if they ≈øpeak not according to this Word, it is becau≈øe there is no Light in them.</hi> There are ≈øome that make the <hi>Light within<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>

Indeed the <hi>Light within,</hi> that is Concience enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is a rule; but it is, <hi>Regula, Regulata,</hi> a Ruled Rule: There is

If therefore you would keep the Way of the Lord, do not de≈øpi≈øe Con≈øcience, do not neglect the Light within, but make it not thy Rule; make the Word of God thy Rule; admit not of any thing that is belonging to the Way of the Lord, that is not ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, or not warranted by his Word.

Like to that, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9. The Word is the heavenly Compa≈øs whereby we may be directed to ≈øteer our cour≈øe aright to the Haven of happine≈øs: Keep you to the Word, while one ≈øays, this is the way, and another that: Try all things by the Rule of the Word, and make that your Rule to walk by. Hence, when <hi>Paul</hi> was taking his leave of the Church at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus,</hi> in that <hi>Acts</hi> 20. in his <hi>Farewel-Sermon;</hi> that after his departure, they might <hi>keep the way of the Lord:</hi> you may read, what he commends to them, <hi>ver≈øe</hi> 32. <hi>And your brethren, I commend you to God, and the Word of his Grace, which is able to build you up, and give you an inheritance among tho≈øe that are ≈øanctified:</hi> He commends the Word of God to them. So, Beloved, now that I may no more ≈øpeak to you from this place, for the teaching of you the <hi>right</hi> and the <hi>good</hi> way, I recommend to you the Word of the Lord; which will be a light to your feet, and a Lanthorn to your paths, to guide you in the Way of the Lord, till you attain the end of your Faith, the Salvation of your ≈øouls. What knowledge I have of the way of the Lord, what I have taught you of the way of the Lord, I have been taught by the Spirit of the Lord, through the Word: and though you want the great help of a plain, powerful, and faithful Mini≈øtry for the future, yet let not tho≈øe that are ≈øincere, in de≈øiring to walk in the way of the Lord, be di≈øcouraged by tho≈øe who would make them believe, that the Word is hard to be under≈øtood: for that, as it is more from malignity in us, than difficulty in the Scriptures, that the mo≈øt do not under≈øtand them; ≈øo they are ea≈øie to be under≈øtood by them that ≈øincerely endeavour; it being not onely mo≈øt plain and

Yea, the entrance of it giveth light: it giveth under≈øtanding to the ≈øimple, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 119.130. And how weak and ≈øimple ≈øoever any of the Saints may be in worldly matters, and in the Worlds account, yet of them all is that ≈øpoken, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.27. <hi>But the anointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you, but as the ≈øame anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lye, even as it hath been taught you, ye ≈øhall abide in him.</hi> Though they corrupt and pervert this Text, that make u≈øe of it to the di≈øannulling of all Mini≈øterial teaching; for if <hi>John</hi> had meant ≈øo, to what purpo≈øe did he write this Epi≈øtle? yet when God depriveth us of this help, this Scripture affords ≈øupport and comfort to the Saints, that by the Spirit in them, they ≈øhall be enabled to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand what he teacheth in the Word, ≈øo as to abide in the Lord and in his Way, as they have been taught.</p>
            <p>Having then the Spirit for your principle and guide, let the Word be your Rule, and you ≈øhall keep the Way of the Lord; according to that promi≈øe, <hi>I≈øaiah</hi> 35.8. <hi>The wayfaring-men, though fools, ≈øhall not erre therein.</hi>

Thus may the meane≈øt actions of your particular Callings become Religious, if they be done as to the Lord, in obedience to his Command, and with re≈øpect to his Glory: Therefore as the Apo≈øtle hath it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.32. <hi>Whether you eat or drink, or whateuer ye do, do all to the glory of God:</hi> Make this your ≈øcope, and it will be of ≈øpecial u≈øe to guide you when the way is doubtful, being indeed propounded by the Apo≈øtle for that end: As a man that is travelling on <hi>Salisbury Plain</hi> towards the City; he comes ≈øometimes where there is no beaten paths, and ≈øometimes where two or three ways meet; now to keep his eye on the City, is the ready cour≈øe to keep him in the right way: So if a man were to draw a ≈øtreight Line to ≈øuch a Point, and hath not a rule to draw by, his readie≈øt way is to keep his eye upon the Point. So when your way is doubtful, and you know not which way to take, take that which is mo≈øt for the glory of God: where you ≈øee not your Rule, keep your eye on the glory of God, and it will be of choice u≈øe to keep you ≈øtreight in the Way of the Lord. And ≈øo much for the fir≈øt branch of the Exhortation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Be exhorted to wait on the Lord, for without this you will not long keep the Way of the Lord, there are ≈øuch troubles, di≈øtre≈ø≈øes, and
<pb facs="tcp:62760:330" rendition="simple:additions"/>tribulations that attend the way of the Lord, that as the Apo≈øtle hath it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.36. <hi>Ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of God, you may inherit the promi≈øe.</hi> So ≈øay I, you have need of Waiting, that you may keep the way of the Lord, and continue therein to the end.</p>
            <p>Wherein the Nature of this Duty lies, and what Encouragements there are to it in the wor≈øt of times, I have lately ≈øhewn you, when I preached on that, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.26. <hi>It is good that a man hope, and wait quietly for the Salvation of the Lord.</hi> Whence I ob≈øerved, That however it go with the people of God, it is good, it is be≈øt for them to hope and wait quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Salvation of the Lord: I ≈øhall therefore only recommend this duty to you, as the work of this dark Day, and conclude with that of our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.35, &amp;c. <hi>And let your Loyns be girded about, and your Lights burning, and ye your ≈øelves like to men that wait for their Lord when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open to him immediately. Ble≈ø≈øed are tho≈øe Servants, whom the Lord when he cometh, ≈øhall finde watching.</hi> Yea, <hi>Keep the Way of the Lord, and wait on him:</hi> For, as ver. 42.43. <hi>Who then is that faithful and wi≈øe Servant, whom his Lord ≈øhall make Ruler over his Hou≈øhold, to give them their portion of meat in due ≈øea≈øon?
